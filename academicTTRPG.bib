  abstract = {This article is dedicated to the issue of achieving consensus in tabletop role-playing games and also addresses the question of how exactly play­ers gain power over the interpretation of events within a tabletop RPG. A tabletop role-playing game presupposes that its participants constantly articulate statements which shift the current configuration of in-game elements and also play the role of being artistic descriptions of said shifts. The alternation and interplay of performative and descriptive statements, their convolution and also the fact that, in tabletop RPGs, unlike in the majority of the rest of the games known to humanity, the same words from natural languages are used both in order to produce a shift in abstract, symbolic structure of a game, and to artistically describe said shift, all lead to the situation where participants cannot tell a proper symbolic system of a given game from other symbolic systems which this game refers to. In this article, we propose an analytical model of a tabletop RPG which would make it possible to draw stricter borderlines between a given RPG’s fictional world and its inner symbolic structure. Furthermore, it would allow us to formulate a clearer question regarding the structures of power produced while playing an RPG, and what exactly players gain control over while playing it. Moreover, this model would enable us to explore in detail the processes of the individual and collective interpretation of events in a tabletop RPG, and classify facts within said interpretation in relation to whether they are held to be objectively or subjectively true.},

There is evidence that clinicians have difficulty treating individuals experiencing social anxiety and there is need for intervention strategies that lower treatment barriers. There has been scant research recognizing the use of table-top role-playing games to incorporate when treating social anxiety. The current manuscript describes a year-long group using Dungeons and Dragons in a therapeutic setting and explores perceptions from participants who experienced this group. Core concepts of the model and lessons learned from the developers are described for clinicians who hope to incorporate such a model. Participants described increased confidence in social situations, particularly with boundaries or making mistakes. Secondly, the skills practiced in the game were transferred into real-world experiences. Implications for future research and limitations were described.},

An additional 45 students participated in an experiment measuring the test–retest reliability of the criminality measure. Regression analysis indicated that RP experience did not relate to self-reported criminality; however, psychoticism, which was higher in the nonplayers, did predict criminality.

We explore several examples of games featuring game world co-creation at the core of their gameplay, and use this to create a model for understanding the commonalities across these various games and how they facilitate this collaborative process. By examining similar structures in the design and play of these games, we can better understand how to identify this process in existing games and how to better create games that allow for this in the future.},

The resulting tool, Shoelace, helps game masters keep track of story events with a graph-based game world visualization, while also providing creative suggestions using Prolog queries over a database of game information.},

Therefore, the goal of this study is to explore the ways in which players fulfill social needs through group communication during the context of D\&D table-top role-play. Utilizing Bormann's (1972) fantasy theme analysis, this study uses a case study approach to identify four themes which emerged within player talk on Facebook: (1) democratic ideologies; (2) friendship maintenance; (3) extraordinary experiences; and (4) good versus evil. Findings provide a description of group members' real-world needs met through symbolic in-game interactions evidenced by communicative markers.},

  abstract = {Reenactment Case Studies: Global Perspectives on Experiential History examines reenactment's challenge to traditional modes of understanding the past, asking how experience-based historical knowledge-making relates to memory-making and politics. Reenactment is a global phenomenon that ncompasses living history, historical reality television, performance art, theater, historically-informed music performance, experimental archeology, pilgrimage, battle reenactment, live-action role play, and other forms. These share a concern with simulating the past via authenticity, embodiment, affect, the performative and subjective. As such, reenactment constitutes a global form of popular historical knowledge-making, representation, and commemoration. Yet, in terms of its historical subject matter, styles, and subcultures, reenactment is often nationally or locally inflected. he book thus asks how domestic reenactment practices relate to global ones, as well as to the spread of new populisms, and postcolonial and decolonizing movements. he book is the first to address these questions through reenactment case studies drawn from various world regions. Forming a companion volume to the Reenactment Studies Handbook: Key Terms in the Field (2020), Reenactment Case Studies s aimed at a wide academic readership, especially in the fields of istory, film studies, memory studies, performance studies, museum and heritage studies, cultural and literary studies, and anthropology.},

Violence within the system’s 5th edition core rulebook, the Player’s Handbook (Wizards of the Coast 2014b), is analysed using textual analysis with insight from previous research on common violence motivators of heroism, hatred, and sensation-seeking curiosity. Overall, the study concludes that the D\&D system facilitates playing violence, specifically through heroic motivation based on androcentric perceptions of chivalric fantasy ideals. This study also finds that the system spotlights combat over nonviolent interactions. Future research could investigate how participant agency may affect violence in similar traditional RPG systems, and why choosing violence in a no-consequence game could reflect real-world behaviours.},

  abstract = {Objectif Cet article étudie comment les joueurs investissent leur avatar au sein du jeu de rôle massivement multijoueur (MMORPG) et la manière dont cela contribue à la construction de soi. Cet espace potentiel particulier conduit les joueurs à la création d’identités narratives, nourries par les échanges et les expériences partagés avec les pairs. Cette identité est l’objet de projections de fragments de soi et de son histoire personnelle qui vont être mis en scène par le biais de l’image, de l’acte et du langage. Méthode Quatre participants ont été recrutés grâce à une annonce déposée sur les serveurs d’échanges de différentes communautés du même jeu en ligne. Les hypothèses ont été évaluées à travers une série de deux entretiens semi-directifs en distanciel reposant sur une grille de dix thèmes. Résultats Les résultats montrent que le jeu de rôle est investi comme un outil de réécriture de l’histoire personnelle grâce auquel les participants peuvent réparer fantasmatiquement blessures et traumatismes individuels et familiaux. Nous observons également que la transparence digitale favorise la spontanéité des communications de par sa fonction désinhibitrice : le jeu de rôle dans les jeux en ligne se révèle être un réel espace potentiel de créativité où les participants peuvent interagir par essai-erreur sans crainte d’être mis en échec et exprimer leurs émotions et désirs sans détruire l’autre ou être détruits, car il s’agit de faire-semblant. Ainsi, ils développent leur subjectivité et tentent un meilleur accordage affectif avec la possibilité d’une meilleure intégration au sein de la communauté humaine virtuelle et matérielle. La transparence digitale, incite les participants à investir le jeu de rôle en tant que lieu de projection et de mise en scène de leurs contenus psychiques sous la forme d’une répétition symbolique où l’histoire familiale, voire le roman familial, sont réinterprétés et deviennent des facteurs de transformation, de réconciliation ou d’émancipation. Discussion Les identités narratives sont un véritable reflet des préoccupations des participants et sont investies pendant et en dehors des séances de jeu. À travers une position de narrateur, les participants échangent et tissent des liens de sens et d’amitié avec les autres joueurs. Ils cherchent à donner un sens à un vécu subjectif partagé qu’ils inscrivent dans leur patrimoine de soi ainsi que dans la mémoire collective du groupe. Ici, le jeu de rôle fournit une forme de contenance pour les éventuels affects dépressifs et détourne l’attention des angoisses, tel le divertissement pascalien. Cet espace pourrait d’abord servir de sorte de prothèse technologique substitutive de fonctions psychiques défaillantes pour certains joueurs qui peinent à exprimer leurs émotions et à tisser des liens. Mais au fil des années, ceux-ci paraissent plutôt se saisir de l’étayage fourni par cette orthèse psychique, de lien et de liaison, pour réécrire leur histoire, aller à la rencontre de l’Autre et d’eux-mêmes. Conclusion Dans ce lieu où les espaces potentiels se chevauchent, les joueurs tentent d’orienter leur propres vies en s’étayant sur les expériences qu’ils ont pu co-construire à travers une narrativité individuelle et commune, présentée comme à la fois étrangère et propre à soi. Ainsi, ils peuvent se sentir mieux armés pour affronter cette intersubjectivité parfois vécue comme décevante ou menaçante que peut être le theatrum mundi.},

  abstract = {Here I bring together Game Studies, Sociology, and Women's and Gender Studies to explore the scope of digital and analog roleplaying communities. Using interviews conducted with 50 participants who reported playing the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons or the digital roleplaying game World of Warcraft and my own experience of games I present evidence and develop theory in existing literature on 3 major axes. The first is women and marginalized identities' participation in the game space. I detail the ways in which women have participated in not only the play of these games since their inception but also how they have held key roles in the development of roleplaying games. The second is how white, male-identified players navigate rule systems based on unexamined, racist assumptions about rules which are in conflict with their understandings of race. Additionally, I discuss the ways in which players who are subject to cultural ‘othering’ in their lived experiences embrace even further othered bodies in virtual spaces. The third articulates a theory about how gamers have thrown open the "gates" of the pastime, but practice mostly at "kitchen tables" which are highly exclusive which creates a divide between the public "face" of gaming, and it's private "heart." These smaller groups operate simultaneously to the larger discourses on the public face of gaming. In these spaces, players can control their environment, who they game with, and thus create safe gaming spaces where they do not have to confront toxic or aggressive discourses in the larger gaming community. Using this I add nuance to larger theories of cultural practice communities which opt instead of forming hierarchies dependent on the ‘right’ way to do things of self-definition and ousting players who do not fit at their tables.},

Thus, this document presents a Pedagogical and Didactic Innovation Proposal for eleventh graders that belong to the public educational system to promote oral interaction in EFL settings through game-based learning and collaborative learning. To this effect, a tabletop role-playing campaign was designed, which aims to encourage students to communicate orally to progress in the game and achieve their common goals. This proposal is divided into nine lesson plans that start with introductory activities, continue with the game sessions, and finish with feedback about the students’ oral performance.},

The workshop's target audience included students from Integrated Technical High School. At the beginning of the workshop, the students answered a diagnostic questionnaire to identify the participants' prior knowledge for subsequent awareness of the proposed theme. After offering these theoretical and practical subsidies, the students were divided into three teams to experience the Tabletop RPG and create an RPG Maker. The workshop was enriching for the participants and the RPG proved to be a resource with potential to assist the meaningful learning process.},

  abstract = {Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs) for disaster response management are collaborative exercises in which participants take on the roles of characters, guided by a “Game Master.” TRPG are useful tools for training, improving the preparedness of emergency responders, and understanding/validating Agent-Based Models (ABMs). This study evaluates the knowledge of participants and assessed the effectiveness of utilizing TRPG in validating a NetLogo model. Medical doctors and master’s students were divided into two groups, who participated in the exercise based on defined disaster response strategies. The central components of the ABM were transformed into a Disaster Response Tabletop Role-Playing Game (DRTRPG). Medical doctors and master’s degree students were assigned to two groups in the exercise that is based on defined disaster response strategies. Multichoice pre- and post-assessment tests were used to evaluate each group’s knowledge, while a performance scoring matrix was used to generate data from in-game activity. Data was analyzed using Pandas and MS Excel data analytical tools. Pre and post-assessment test results (n = 8) showed an 11.5\% and 3.1\% increase in knowledge for medical doctors and students on disaster and healthcare decision-making, respectively. Visual comparison between the ABM and DRTRPG results reveals partial model validity. However, statistical comparison shows a clear variation in the outcomes. The “Alternate” policy strategy resulted in better disaster response outcomes. The design and implementation of the DRTRPG resulted in a collaborative understanding and communication of the ABMS model with promising results. However, there are significant statistical differences between both methodologies, highlighting the challenge of validating the predictive capabilities of ABMS using RPGs.},

  abstract = {The chapter explores contemporary reiterations of the druid myth from the perspective of semantic field research. Three areas—or mythologems—form the subject of analysis. First, the proto-myth of the druid, deriving from Classical sources, is described. The chapter moves on to the exploration of contemporary mythical ideas. The vision of “who a druid-should-be” within contemporary Druidry is addressed through examples of the two main Druidic organisations: the Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids (the UK) and Ár nDraíocht Féin (the United States). Current pop-cultural images of druids found in (more or less) mainstream content—movies, series, or games—are the third field to be studied. Finally, it presents a comparative analysis of those respective portraits utilising semantic field analysis, adapted from Régine Robin’s approach. The chapter discusses the following issues: to what extent is the current image of the druids (in)coherent with the core mythologem? How is the druid’s image adapted for the needs of contemporary druids? Are there similarities or differences between the pop-cultural image of druids and the imaginaries of the movement’s sympathisers, and is there feedback between those fields? And last, but not least, how (and which) chosen mythical threads are intertwined to form the portrait of the druid observed by receivers of the contemporary cultural landscape?},

  abstract = {Dungeons \& Dragons at its core is roleplay based storytelling, which implies the idea that the game is a work of fiction. While the world of Iad and the Free States of Tarvan does not exist on planet earth, the experiences and emotions felt by the players and their characters within the world are very much real. Players use extensions of themselves, their characters, to interact with the world around them, forging relationships and new lines of fate and destiny. Characters are fractals of their out of game personas, attached to one’s base personality and expanding outwards. The development of a character is heavily influenced by a player’s own history and frame of reference, but also the ritual of immersion. Immersion is the core part of this process, allowing players and their Dungeon Master to jump between the two worlds interchangeably. These worlds run parallel and simultaneously with each other during campaign sessions, allowing players to interact with both. At the end of the day, the DnD group Cantrips and Chaos has fostered a subcultural dynamic that functions at two different levels. Players have the unique capability of developing characters that reflect themselves and directly impact a world that is different from their own in meaningful, and sometimes truly chaotic ways.},

This project leverages a Large Language Model to simplify the onboarding process for new players, enabling a more seamless introduction to the game. The tool developed through this thesis assists in narrative and content creation tailored to the specific characteristics and preferences of player groups, facilitating engagement in scenarios that align with their learning objectives. To evaluate the system, we conducted a mixed-methods evaluation involving both qualitative feedback from focus groups and quantitative data analysis to assess the effectiveness of the system. Results indicate that the automated materials might help reduce preparation time and support the initial gaming experience by providing coherent, engaging, and highly customizable content. The system was particularly effective in helping new players create customised characters with ease and in boosting confidence levels among players with low experience. The findings may also have implications for the design of other complex games and educational frameworks, where AI can play a role in reducing entry barriers and enhancing learning processes.},

  abstract = {Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) is a role-playing game typically played face-to-face with participants seated around a tabletop. Online technologies have enabled the conduct of live sessions on virtual platforms, allowing players to continue enjoying the game despite geographic distances. Playing D\&D relies heavily on a dungeon master who is tasked with preparing the fictional world and facilitating the interaction between players who each control a single story character. In this paper, we investigate the impact of employing AI techniques in designing a virtual dungeon master (VDM) on the gameplay experience of D\&D players. The VDM utilizes Open AI’s GPT2 model to generate story prompts in combination with an input plausibility checker, a dice rolling feature, and a candidate story prompt scorer. Feedback from D\&D players revealed that the VDM is capable of producing believable fantasy stories but lacks consistency in the quality of its generated stories. Our findings point to the potential abilities of an artificially intelligent agent in engaging human D\&D players in role-playing games; however, the VDM is still not capable of truly replicating the experience of playing with a human DM.},

The ability to understand and sort out pieces of reliable information and fake news has become a fundamental cognitive skill. In this study we report on the development of a serious game (a card-based role-playing game) using Brazilian folk heroes aimed to develop critical thinking skills to empower vulnerable communities affected by misinformation and fake news. Four groups located in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) participated in this research: one group of people experiencing homelessness; two groups of favela residents (one urban and one in the suburbs) and one group of recyclable material collectors from a cooperative. We gained entry and built trust with each of these groups and worked together for 10 months during the pandemic. We conducted participatory observations, individual interviews with each participant and discussed their daily interaction with information, specifically in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. The analyses of the observations and interview data gave us a glimpse of the communicative needs of the groups. Inserting players into a narrative where they can make decisions based on critical thinking and their own reflections on the pandemic was important for building knowledge and developing critical thinking in these communities. The nature of the game (interactive and cooperative) allowed participants to focus on problem-solving skills and group work.

  abstract = {This project aims to explore how interactive tangible playthings can be designed to enhance the roleplaying aspect of Dungeons \& Dragons. Further, the project juxtaposed D\&D and interaction design as practices to examine if D\&D can contribute to interaction design. The project adopted research through design methodology and applied different methods, emphasizing playful and movement-based approaches. A handful of tangible electronic prototypes were created using Arduino Nano BLE Sense, gesture recognition combined with a NeoPixel Circle, a Humidifier, and a Vibration motor combined with 3D-printed objects. The prototypes were tested during a D\&D playing session to evaluate their impact on the roleplaying experience. The result of the project suggests that interactive tangible artifacts enhance the experiential, expressive, and sensory qualities of roleplaying in D\&D by adding interactivity and tangibility. Furthermore, the results suggest that the playthings increase the player's connection to their character. Finally, the project's result suggests that interaction design can learn from D\&D's playful and creative nature by adopting the Magic Circle concept to interaction design methodology.},

The thesis examines the history of drama therapy as well as the origin and mechanics of table-top role playing games, using the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons as a central example. Overlap between drama therapy techniques and aspects of table-top role playing games is explored. The thesis culminates in a group of sample scenarios that could potentially be used to introduce difficult topics in an in-game, therapeutic setting.},

  abstract = {Introduction More than 400 years after it was written, Shakespeare’s The Tempest continues to be republished, restaged and remediated into different forms, prompting new ways of seeing and analyzing the play. This research paper examines the process of transmedia adaptation through the case study of Shakespeare’s The Tempest adapted into a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) module. The Tempest is remediated as an interactive game based on Wizards of the Coast’s Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition ruleset, designed to be facilitated by a Dungeon Master and played by a group of three to five players. The process of remediating The Tempest takes the play’s setting, characters, narrative conflict, and dialogue and translates them into the formal structure of the TTRPG, prompting questions that have long been asked in adaptation studies: how important is fidelity to the source text? What is lost, gained, and changed in transmedia translation? What role does the translator play in the creation of the adaptation?},

  abstract = {This is Free Trader Beowulf, calling anyone … Mayday, Mayday. A box emblazoned with those words went on sale for the first time on July 22, 1977, at the Origins III Game Fair, heralding the advent of the Traveller roleplaying game from GDW. It wasn’t the first science-fiction roleplaying game, but through its innovative design and through the development of its evocative universe of Charted Space, it would become the longest running SFRPG in the industry. However, its path would not be simple. After Traveller reached its early apogee just four years in, it would face decades of increasing problems, raising many questions. Why did GDW decided to shatter their Imperium? What led them to seek outside help to produce the second edition of the game? Why did they abandon the Traveller game system with their next revision? How could such a popular publisher face bankruptcy just two decades on? Similarly, what happened to Imperium Games, QuikLink Interactive, and others who followed in GDW’s footsteps as the inheritors of the Traveller legacy? And finally, how did Mongoose Publishing reach into the past and bring Traveller back to its position as the industry’s best-loved SFRPG? This volume answers those questions and more. It tracks Traveller from its inspirations in the early ’70s, though its initial publication, and across seven distinct editions of its original 2d6 gaming system. It reveals the stories of Traveller’s three major publishers; GDW, Imperium Games, and Mongoose, as well many licensees. Most importantly, it tells how Traveller fell into increasing darkness before descending into a Long Night, and how it rose again as a phoenix. From the author of Designers \& Dragons, which told the story of the entire roleplaying industry, comes the intimate history of a single roleplaying game, culled from hundreds of primary sources and interviews.

  abstract = {BackgroundRole-playing game (RPG) is a term that covers a series of forms and styles of games that involve, in some way, the creation, representation and progression of characters who interact in a fictional world under a system of structured rules. Its applications and effects on human behavior and mental health are, however, still an underexplored area.MethodsA scoping review was performed on the literature about RPGs as a therapeutic tool or prevention strategy in psychotherapies and mental health, highlighting studies? populations, forms of RPG and interventions used. To that, a systematic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, BVS/LILACS databases and grey literature was performed.ResultsOf the 4,069 studies reviewed, 50 sources of evidence were included. The majority was published as of 2011 (78\%) in journals (62\%) and targeted therapeutic uses of RPGs (84\%). Most interventions used computer (50\%) or tabletop RPGs (44\%), mostly with cognitive and/or behavioral (52\%) therapeutical approaches and targeting adolescents (70\%).ConclusionThe findings suggest a potential use of RPGs as a complementary tool in psychotherapies. However, only 16\% of the studies included were experimental. We identified considerable heterogeneity in RPGs definitions, outcomes and interventions used, preventing a systematic review. Thus, more empirical and well-designed studies on the application of RPGs in mental health are needed.},

  abstract = {Pop culture-driven nostalgia for the times of the second half of the 20th century - with their music, aesthetics and entertainment, in combination with the increased need for casual interpersonal contacts observed during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a kind of renaissance of classic tabletop board and Role-Playing Games. At the same time, the pandemic necessity of isolation has led to the emergence of new solutions in the field of social but remote entertainment - specially through software called Virtual Tabletops (VTT). In classic RPGs such as "Dungeons and Dragons" players often use boards, mockups, models, dioramas and miniatures for tactical orientation in situations where it is essential from the mechanics point of view (e.g. during combat sequences). Virtual game tables allowed for this types of props to be digitized including automation of some mechanical activities related to the game (statistics of objects, markers for area effects, fields of view, fogs of war etc.). This turned out to be so attractive that some players began to mix the classic pen and paper RPG’s gameplay (requiring the physical presence of players at the table and face to face communication), with virtual tools which then allow for projection onto table’s surface, walls or to the TVs, tablets and smartphones. This niche but extremely interesting example of vernacular practices in computer based media seem worth further investigation.},

  abstract = {Role-playing games are a diverse phenomenon, ranging from digital games to live action role-playing. Finding a definition that suits them all is hard, but attempts have been many. All of the definitions emphasize some aspects of role-playing games like rules, the role of players or the story. Many definitions do not describe role-playing games as such, but the activity that is role-playing. This paper looks at one of the latest attempts to define role-playing games, by Hitchens and Drachen (2009), and shows some potential problems with it. As an answer to these problems another definition is proposed, consisting of a game world, participants, shared narrative power and interaction. This definition is given only after discussing the nature of definitions in general. By drawing from the work of Wittgenstein, it is shown that definitions are by their nature bound to language in a way Wittgenstein calls language-games. Language is constantly changing, as the culture surrounding it changes. There are no final definitions for role-playing games, only definitions suited better or worse to a certain historical understanding of role-playing games. However, this does not mean that role-playing games should not be defined, as the definitions given can advance our understanding of what role-playing games are and could be. This paper takes part in the ongoing process of definition.},

  abstract = {Clinical training in the delivery of gamified psychotherapeutic interventions is increasingly available in the United States, despite the current lack of strong empirical evidence for this approach. These interventions are purported to be more acceptable, engaging, and intrinsically motivating than available alternatives. The present pilot and treatment development study proposed a theoretical approach to empirically evaluate the claim gamified psychotherapies represent an intrinsically motivating treatment approach, and to explore the outcome and acceptability of the therapeutic tabletop role-playing game (TTT-RPG) developed by the author for small group delivery of adapted dialectical behavioral therapy skills training (DBT-ST). A non-clinical sample of 287 university students seeking interpersonal skills training completed an online pre-screening survey, providing self-report data on baseline variables of interest (e.g., demographics, interpersonal distress, etc.) as well as the acceptability of both TTT-RPG and a more traditional group skills training alternative. Thirty-three students from this initial sample then participated in at least one session of TTT-RPG, with twenty-five completing the protocol over the course of three weekly sessions (approximately 3.5 hours each). Completers provided self-report data on changes in interpersonal distress and acceptability over time, as well as motivation, perceived progress in skills training, group positive bond, and usability/playability. At baseline, students found the TTT-RPG to be more acceptable than a more traditional alternative. Following participation significant changes were observed in TTT-RPG acceptability (increasing) and interpersonal distress (decreasing). Further, participants reported high levels of perceived progress, group positive bond, and usability/playability. These data provided evidence of the usability, acceptability, and potential for further development of TTT-RPG for therapeutic use.},

  abstract = {This article offers an overview of the history of Italian gamebooks and interprets some of its most relevant traits. The form originated in the UK and the USA in the 1970s, and reached Italy through translations published mainly by Edizioni EL. The article shows how these translations shaped the perception of what gamebooks could and should be in Italy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the market for gamebooks was so dominated by foreign authors that gamebooks written by Italians lacked visibility and continuity, and in some cases were manipulated to look like translations from foreign languages. While readers of gamebooks in the 1980s and early 1990s were mainly tweens and teens, early Italian gamebooks tended to target adult readers, and this, too, affected the circulation of the works. The article then proceeds to discuss the blooming of the gamebook among 21st-century Italian authors. These authors tend to borrow ideas mainly from foreign precedents rather than early Italian experiments, and they write for adults comprising the same readers who were young in the 1980s. The rich and developing world of the new Italian gamebooks is interpreted through the filter of three concepts: experiential nostalgia (which adds complexity to earlier models to ensure that now-adult readers face a comparable experience to the one they had back then); ironic homage (through which authors acknowledge their foreign models); and literary awareness (through the use of paratexts that frame their works as proper literary endeavors).},

  abstract = {The essay discusses how the gamebook form derives specific traits, affordances, and limitations from its being a material technology for the creation of meaning. These elements are discussed in the perspective of the author designing a gamebook and that of a reader navigating the text. The discussion allows us to understand the surprising resilience of the gamebook in today's digitally mediated world, as it is precisely its material nature that gives it a unique positioning in the field of interactive entertainment. After demonstrating the relevance of the gamebook in the present, the article discusses the material elements of the gamebook's three components: the section, the text, and the link. We see how the partition of the work into sections may interfere with the partition of the physical artifact into pages; how the inalterable fabric of the text can relate to a population of diverse readers; and how the explicit nature of the links can create peculiar types of spoilers. The impact of the spatial disposition of the sections in the book is discussed also. Next, the article analyzes the tension between the structure of the gamebook, which proceeds by prescribed reading paths, and the fact that the book is materially open to unauthorized interactions. The discussion focuses on purposeful departures from prescribed reading paths (cheating) and cases in which the author creatively exploited the material nature of the gamebook through mechanisms that require abandoning the narrative tree to be fully appreciated.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are increasingly used in therapeutic and educational settings to improve the well-being of autistic people. This study investigated the potential of TTRPGs to provide a safe space where autistic adults could develop relationships with others while also engaging in character and world-building. Eight autistic adults were split into two groups and taken through a 6-week online Dungeons and Dragons campaign run by one of the researchers. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted to discuss how participants felt interacting in and out of the TTRPG. Several key themes were identified as important aspects of why autistic people could benefit from role-playing environments. The analysis showed that the participants felt a strong level of enjoyment from engaging in tabletop role-playing and, in many ways, experienced better social interactions during the TTRPG. The results suggested that TTRPGs can provide a safe space for autistic adults to engage in meaningful social interactions with like-minded individuals. Role-playing may also allow autistic participants to rewrite their own life stories through their characters’ adventures, leading to improved self-esteem.Lay abstractTabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are popular hobbies that may offer specific social benefits for autistic people. This study investigated the ability of TTRPGs to provide a safe space where autistic adults could develop relationships with other autistic adults while engaging in character and world-building. A group of eight autistic adults were split into two groups and taken through a short-form online Dungeons and Dragons campaign over 6 weeks run by one of the researchers. The researcher then led a series of individual semi-structured interviews discussing how participants felt interacting in and out of the TTRPG. Several key themes were identified as important aspects of why autistic people could benefit from such an environment. Analysis showed that while real-life interactions could be challenging, in TTRPG play, they felt they experienced significantly fewer struggles. Results suggested that TTRPGs can provide a safe space environment where autistic adults can engage in productive social interactions with like-minded individuals. It also may allow autistic participants to experience ‘bleed’ or the ability to take on a new character that changes the way they feel about themselves outside of the game. Future directions for this work are discussed.},

A study was conducted into tabletop roleplaying games, using theoretical lenses from both information research and tabletop roleplaying game research, to observe the complexity of the relationship between the players and the official rulebooks. Method. A series of qualitative interviews was conducted with two groups of tabletop roleplaying gamers (a large, established group and a smaller, group of less experienced players) based on how they interact with the source material (the rulebooks). Analysis. Coded transcripts were analysed for trends and patterns of discourse, and the theoretical perspective of sense-making (from information research) was applied, to provide meaning to two common and related discursive frameworks from tabletop roleplaying research: the divide between ludologists (or role players); and how illicit knowledge is constructed through metagaming. Results. The study found the discursive frameworks surrounding metagaming and the role/roll player divide to be less a dividing factor and more a concept all players grasped with in the project of co-creating a fantastic reality: a sense-making process. Conclusions. From the point of information research, the study found that tabletop roleplaying games are an example of an information-rich leisure activity that allows and encourages its participants to ignore the official rules surrounding it. From the point of view of tabletop roleplaying game literature, the study casts doubt on the role/roll player dyad commonly adopted by theorists.},

  abstract = {« Le jeu est le refoulé des études littéraires », écrit Michel Picard en 1986. A la suite de cette remarque, nous souhaitons envisager, dans une démarche didactique, l’articulation du jeu et de la lecture d’une œuvre patrimoniale complexe en cours de français. Il s’agit de (ré)concilier la sphère ludologique et la sphère didactique de la littérature en proposant un dispositif de lecture qui permette à tous les lecteurs, et même les plus faibles, de lycée général, de lire une tragédie racinienne. Nous défendons la thèse que le jeu de rôle explicite, au sein de la classe, le jeu de la lecture, à la fois intime et social, faisant alors apparaître, autour d’un texte scolaire, obligatoire et difficile, un véritable plaisir de la lecture partagé entre pairs. Il nous semble voir là une piste, dans le prolongement de la recherche didactique et des travaux sur le sujet-lecteur, pour motiver la lecture d’œuvres patrimoniales. Tout d’abord, nous définissons l’immersion fictionnelle, source de plaisir commune à la lecture et au jeu de rôle. Puis, nous avons observé comment la question de la motivation a été envisagée au sein de la didactique de la littérature pour engager les élèves tout en con-sidérant l’œuvre patrimoniale comme un objet d’enseignement. Enfin, nous avons pensé précisé-ment le jeu de rôle comme point de rencontre entre la ludologie et les études littéraires. Notre attention s’est portée sur la lecture des tragédies raciniennes en classe, œuvres au statut en partie éminemment scolaire qui sont difficiles et éloignées des jeunes lycéens. Ensuite, nous présentons un dispositif de lecture qui modifie en profondeur le cheminement de la lecture, associant la tragédie classique à une partie de jeu de rôle : la lecture devient collaborative entre pairs,réunis en « cercles de personnage ».Nos travaux présentent les résultats d’une recherche exploratoire menée dans quatre classes de lycée général. Nous formulons l’hypothèse qu’un tel dispositif ludique permet non seulement de motiver la lecture auprès de tous les lycéens, même les non-lecteurs, mais leur donne aussi la possibilité de s’approprier personnellement le texte au sein de la collectivité de la classe tout en développant des compétences.},

A metodologia fundamenta-se na Pesquisa Baseada em Design e inclui pré-análise, teoria norteadora; validação e utilização do jogo em sala de aula, e avaliação. A pré-análise faz um resgate histórico do jogo e dos seus objetivos educacionais iniciais, utilizando-se dos fundamentos da Teoria dos Campos Conceituais. A validação é consolidada por 14 participantes de um curso de formação pelo Programa Nacional de Alfabetização na Idade Certa. A utilização do jogo em sala de aula é concretizada em dois estudos empíricos, piloto e principal, compostos por pré-teste, vivência do jogo e pós-teste. Ambos os estudos foram conduzidos por participantes daquele curso de formação que atuavam em turmas de 2º, 3º e 4° do Ensino Fundamental. No estudo piloto identificou-se o interesse dos estudantes pelo jogo e previram-se adaptações necessárias para facilitar a sua jogabilidade. No estudo principal consideraram-se essas adaptações e também contribuições dos participantes daquele grupo de formação. O jogo possibilitou um trabalho lúdico e cooperativo, sendo essas características típicas daqueles de RPG. A atividade matemática dos alunos foi constante ao longo das jogadas e na medida em que avançavam nas casas do tabuleiro. O jogo possui potencial para o trabalho em sala de aula, podendo ter uma maior contribuição se utilizado em turmas do 4° ano.},

  abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have revealed that adolescents with chronic physical or mental conditions (CPMCs) are at an increased risk for depression and anxiety, with serious direct and indirect negative effects on treatment adherence, family functioning, and health-related quality of life. As game-based approaches are effective interventions in treating anxiety and depression, we propose to explore the use of a multiplayer role-playing game (RPG) as a potential intervention for social isolation, anxiety, and depression. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the feasibility of using Masks, a multiplayer RPG, as an intervention for social isolation, anxiety, and depression in adolescents with CPMCs; (2) evaluate the viability of the research process; and (3) gauge participation in and engagement with RPG-based interventions. Methods: This study is a remote synchronous game-based intervention for adolescents with CPMCs aged 14-19 years. Eligible participants completed a web-based baseline survey to assess anxiety, depression, and social isolation and to identify their gaming habits. After completing the baseline survey, they participated in 5 moderated Masks game sessions. In Masks, players assume the roles of young superheroes; select their character types, superpowers; and perform actions determined by the game’s rule system and dice rolls. All game sessions were played using Discord, a communication platform commonly used by gaming communities. Games were led and moderated by game masters (GMs). After each game session, participants completed surveys to assess changes in anxiety, depression, and social isolation, and their attitude toward the game and the user experience. The participants also completed an exit survey after all 5 game sessions (modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, and 17 open-ended questions). The GMs rated each game session and reported on gameplay, player behavior, comfort, and engagement levels of the players. Results: As of March 2020, six participants were recruited for the pilot study to participate in moderated web-based game sessions of Masks; 3 completed all game sessions and all required assessments. Although the number of participants was too low to draw generalizable conclusions, self-reported clinical outcomes did seem to indicate a positive change in depression, anxiety, and social isolation symptoms. Qualitative analysis of postgame survey data from participants and GMs indicated high levels of engagement and enjoyment. Furthermore, the participants provided feedback about improved mood and engagement related to weekly participation in Masks. Lastly, responses to the exit survey showed interest in future RPG-related studies. Conclusions: We established a workflow for gameplay and evaluated a research protocol for evaluating the impact of RPG participation on isolation, anxiety, and depression symptoms in adolescents with CPMCs. Preliminary data collected from the pilot study support the validity of the research protocol and the use of RPG-based interventions in larger clinical studies. Trial Registration:},

  abstract = {In an era where serialization prevails across all media, particularly in digital formats, understanding how these repetitive patterns impact the consumption of popular and mass media is crucial. Final Fantasy stands as a massively popular and highly serialized game series. Thus, this study seeks to comprehend the seriality present within the Final Fantasy game series. It intends to achieve this by employing the categorization proposed by Denson and Jahn-Sudmann, Umberto Eco’s taxonomy of serial production. The research primarily centers on the internal workings of the games themselves, particularly the main series and the serialized features within and between installments in the series. Analyzing the repeated patterns in comparison to features that have changed from game-to-game show that initially, FF incorporates elements from a broader context, including fantasy literature, manga and anime, TTRPG, and CRPGs. However, it then modifies these elements based on its own preferences. In this process, FF develops its own encyclopedia or database. Consequently, when creating each new game, the series draws from this database, reusing some elements and altering others. Therefore, the common thread linking all the installments in the series is not a single character, game mechanic, or universe, but rather a database or the encyclopedia.},

  abstract = {The concept of neurodiversity has fuelled a social justice movement advocating for the rights of those whose lives diverge from a socially-constructed default. However, deficit understandings of disability persist in educational settings and neurodivergent people continue to face disadvantage and discrimination in organisations constructed on normative understandings of the world. Although New Literacy Studies is concerned with ideas of power, dominance and worth, there is a notable lack of work that connects NLS with issues of neurodiversity. In this paper, I introduce the term ‘neurodivergent literacies’ to propose a field of study that links the ideological model of literacy with the neurodiversity paradigm. From this starting point, I outline a project that examined literacies around what are often referred to as the ‘special interests’ of autistic people. Presenting data from interviews with 13 neurodivergent adults, related to school experiences and the literacies they engage with around their self-defined ‘ruling passions’, I make recommendations for literacies practitioners, arguing that schools need to do more to take account of difference and disability. By describing how ‘neurodivergent literacies’ can help teachers harness their own critical literacy skills to challenge deficit models of difference in the classroom, this paper illuminates how an understanding of neurodiversity is essential for anyone teaching and researching literacies with a commitment to social justice.},

  abstract = {Queer experience has, until very recently, been invisible or significantly misrepresented in cultural and scholarly fields of record including history, sociology, and ethnography. Self-recording of our lives, communities, and culture has occurred almost exclusively through non-formal means. Queer heritage has seen recent scholarly study of these non-formal means in the form of archives of oral histories, ephemera, and ethnographies. This work emphasises the critical role safer community, social, and performance spaces play in containing, creating, and disseminating queer histories and heritage. Despite this increased visibility, the need for more grassroots expressions of nonnormative genders and sexualities remains crucial for queer people to find support. As part of my wider work exploring the potential live action role-playing games (larps) might have for the exploration of gender subjectivity through play, in this paper I suggest that larps can also provide a space to document, disseminate, and educate on queer experience, history, and culture. Larp is a democratic form of expression that does not require performance skill or training, but rather allows people to experience empowerment, including for those who come from marginalized backgrounds, i.e., through emancipatory bleed (Kemper 2020; Baird 2021; Cazeneuve 2021). Larp has on occasion been used for non-formal education on queer history, such as in the larp Just a Little Lovin’ (2011) about the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, which includes educational workshops and debriefs on notable historical and cultural themes (Groth, Grasmo, and Edland 2022). Larp used this way is not dissimilar to the way queer social and performance space has been co-created as a container for both meaning-making and heritage for LGBTQIA+ people. On this basis, I argue that game design that seeks to reflect and represent this kind of queer cultural production in social and performance spaces may allow for the non-formal education on LGBTQIA+ lives and heritage, as well as opportunities for personal (gender) expression, exploration, and embodiment.},

  abstract = {Magic, magical qualities and phenomena, and magical items are often featured in various types of games. They can be depicted in a plethora of different ways, and be used as narrative or world building tools in game texts. Magic in games can be discussed and analysed as a game mechanic that influences the gameplay—for example when the player’s avatar is brought back to life because resurrection magic exists in the game world—or as the main plot point around which the entire story of a game is based on—such as in the case where the player has to fulfil various tasks in the game to lift an evil curse. This paper will focus primarily on magic as an element that facilitates the creation and development of different identities in a variety of games, as well as on the different ways of depicting, defining and classifying magic and the manner in which they influence potential individual and group identities in specific games. Based on examples of tabletop role-playing games and digital games, the paper will explore and analyse the way in which games depict and define diverse types of magic influencing and shaping the identities of singular entities, as well as larger groups, communities, classes, and even entire races of beings.},

  abstract = {Accounts of trans people using role-playing games (RPGs) as a safer space to “try out” another way to be gendered can be found in numerous sites – from the memetic, to the anecdotal, to the academic. Using autoethnography and post-structuralist queer theory of performativity in combination with scholarly perspectives of RPGs as sites for potentially transformative experiences, I consider the ways in which live-action role-playing games (larps) might help trans people express, explore, and embody their subjectivity. I argue that despite there being a relatively small (though growing) number of larps designed to encourage players to consider gender and sexuality norms in society, there remains no larp that intentionally allows trans people (or those questioning their gender) to consider their gender subjectivity therein. Scholarly perspectives on larps suggest that they might provide a site for the simulation of complex socio-cultural dynamics, a space to adopt different social roles, and the alibi and scaffolding to do so in a way that is validating with a community of like-minded role-players (Deterding 2018; Bowman and Hugaas 2021). I present examples of larps that, either by design or not, seem to have provided opportunities for gender role-play and transformative experiences for some trans players. I consider the possible limitations the embodied experience of larps -- as opposed to digital and table-top RPGs (TRPGs) -- might have in allowing such exploration for some trans players, particularly in potentially transphobic play environments. I argue however, that the embodied nature of larps might also provide an opportunity to explore gender role-play in such a way that allows for the validation of more diverse physical and social gender presentations, as well as the rehearsal thereof in a safer space. I present accounts of trans people -- including my own autoethnography -- using role-playing games, larps, and other activities/environments not necessarily consciously designed for the purpose of gender exploration as the basis for how this might be designed for intentionally in larps. I conclude by proposing to design a larp that could provide an opportunity to express, explore, and embody non-normative gender, and I pose a series of questions that I believe such a design should seek to answer.},

  abstract = {The field of feminist studies grew from the U.S. women's movements of the 1960s and 1970s and has continued to be deeply connected to ongoing movements for social justice. As educational institutions are increasingly seeing public scholarship and community engagement as relevant and fruitful complements to traditional academic work, feminist scholars have much to offer in demonstrating different ways to inform and interact with various communities. In Public Feminisms: From Academy to Community edited by Carrie N. Baker and Aviva Dove-Viebahn, a diverse range of feminist scholar-activists write about the dynamic and varied methods they use to reach beyond the traditional academic classroom and scholarly journals to share their work with the public.    Part one explores how feminist scholars engage broader audiences through art, media, and public programming, including essays on a public discussion series teaching intersectional feminist analysis of popular films, and a podcast from Latina scholars discussing issues of reproductive justice, social justice, motherhood, sexuality, race, and gender. Part two focuses on activism and public education, including essays on "Take Back the Night," and archiving the women's march protests. Part three turns to public writing and scholarship, including an essay on elevating the perspectives and voices of underrepresented creatives in the film and television industry. Part four explores feminist pedagogies for community engagement and for teaching public feminisms.    Accessible and engaging to a broad range of readers, the essays in this volume are a rich resource for scholars and students interested in infusing their academic knowledge into the public sphere. With this timely book, the editors offer an opportunity to reflect on the meaning and importance of community engagement and highlight some of the important public-facing work feminist scholars are doing today. Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students, as well as administrators hoping to increase their schools' connections to the community, will find this volume indispensable.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 has impacted the mental health of the general public negatively, associated with preventative measures, restricting life activities. These restrictions, such as the stay-at-home strategy, resulted in heightened stress, depression, loneliness, substance abuse, and domestic violence, violating people’s occupational and personal lives. During the pandemic, the demands for role-play games (RPGs) have increased: for example, the sales of “Dungeons \& Dragons” tripled, underscoring the potential mental health benefits of such games. However, research into the mental health benefits of such games remains under-developed, needing more scientific attention. Accordingly, this commentary paper reviews the existing literature, and suggests areas for application and research about RPGs and mental health including psychotherapy, career guidance, education, and people with disabilities. Insights offered can help practitioners and researchers in RPGs and mental health conduct empirical research and develop alternative approaches for mental health in stressful times.},

  abstract = {Colonization has impacted Native Hawaiians for centuries, destroying culture, language, and community, and exacerbating disasters such as COVID-19. However, a renaissance of Hawaiian culture has emerged, marked by increased longevity, education, and social mobility among Native Hawaiians. In this restorative spirit, we present Kaona, a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) and digital storyteller, designed to foster youth wellbeing from a Native Hawaiian perspective, by introducing the values of lōkahi (harmony). Kaona engages players in culturally revitalizing gameplay, integrating technologies to enrich immersion as players collaborate to restore balance to the realms they explore. Players problem-solve, self-reflect, and build community as they navigate complex quests inspired by local lived experiences and Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories and legends). This paper details Kaona’s development, iterative playtesting, and our initial observations, presenting culturally restorative, community-informed RPGs as a promising avenue for empowering Native Hawaiian youth, fostering community wellbeing, and inspiring Indigenous futures.},

  abstract = {Table-top Role Playing Games (RPGs) have risen in popularity since their conception in the 1970’s. While some literature has explored their emergent psychological processes, very few studies have explicitly reflected on the therapeutic potential of these games, particularly from a phenomenological perspective. In this study, views, perceptions, and experiences of eight UK-based players were gathered through semi-structured interviews assisted by multi-modal diaries. These interviews were then transcribed and analysed through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The analysis settled on two superordinate themes. ‘Symbolic Play’ consisted of two sub-themes: ‘Expression Through Play’, which captured participants’ idiosyncratic experiences of projecting fears, fantasies, desires, and taboos onto their characters; and ‘Working Through Difficulties’, which illustrates how players symbolically navigate their past experiences, or current difficulties through their character and the worlds they co-produce. The second superordinate theme ‘When Players Come Together’ also embodied two sub-themes: ‘Playing In Person Helps with Immersion’, which explored the experience of moving to online play from face-to-face as a result of the COVID-19 social restrictions, highlighting the importance of intimacy and physical proximity when playing in person; and ‘When Things Fall Apart: The Significance and Perils of the Group’, which examined conflicts the participants experienced as part of the role playing group, exploring what is counter-therapeutic in an attempt to provide an answer to what is therapeutic. I conclude by arguing that tabletop role-playing games play stage to profoundly therapeutic processes such as play, symbolism, containment, mirroring, and witnessing as they show us how players relate to themselves and the group. Strengths and limitations of the study are examined before arriving at some tentative 6 recommendations regarding the value of role-playing vis-à-vis therapeutic growth, amongst other implications of the study. Reflexive commentary is offered throughout the thesis in an attempt to both bracket and pay attention to the phenomenology of the researcher, which has contributed to the double hermeneutic of sense-making in this research.},

  abstract = {Roleplaying activities of various sorts are frequently used to train specific skills or to conduct social science studies. The research on the use of roleplays finds that the more realistic the roleplay, the more effective it is as a teaching tool, at least for easily definable behaviors. Activities such as leadership, decision making, and working with a group are all behaviors that are difficult to precisely define but which are also critically important to the ability of a group to accomplish a task. Research on groups finds that groups are more effective when group members are better educated about each of these topics. Viewed from a Dramaturgical perspective, leadership, decision making, and working with a group can be seen as group members filling certain roles and engaging in role appropriate activities in order to accomplish the tasks of the group and manage the impressions group members have of one another. This study employed a qualitative, grounded theory methodology to explore how participants in Live Action Role Playing (LARP) games, a form of immersive, complex, plot-driven roleplay perceive leadership, decision making, and working with a group. A total of 14 participants provided rich, detailed responses to an open-ended questionnaire that explored their perceptions of each of the three topics being investigated, and also explored how they perceived LARP as influencing those perceptions. Based on the results of the study, a theory was developed connecting LARP participation to an enhanced ability to understand leadership, decision making, and working with a group.},

It fathoms the extent to which role-playing games without a didactical goal still have didactical potential, as well as the extent to which this potential is being exploited. Along the lines of the concept of surplus reality, I specifically look into the subject of the role-playing game’s alternative reality and demonstrate that the didactical potential of methodically applied role-playing can only unfold by means of the generation of an isomorphous model of a real subject matter. It can then be shown that recreational live role-playing indeed has an enormous didactical potential, just like the methodically applied kind. This potential unfolds just like in methodically applied role-playing, as live role-playing generates an isomorphous model of our reality. On the basis of these explanations I conclude with the development of a process-oriented definition of immersion, which allows for an intermediary perspective on the phenomenon of immersion, instead of a purely subjective one.},

This study evaluated potential differences in character identification and interaction in a gaming context affording various character materialities: the role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons. Multimethod analysis of online survey data (N\,=\,1,135) reveals that character identification and interaction dimensions were invariant across primary character-representation mode (figurine, physical image, digital image, written, and imagined); however, post-hoc analysis suggests that multimaterial assemblages and social factors are key in how character representations are linked to character relations. Following, we argue that game characters may be more appropriately understood as subjective experiences rather than varying according to a given digital or physical manifestation.},

Ce travail s’inscrit dans une réflexion générale portée par les sciences du jeu autour de la question de l’engagement ludique (Huizinga 1938, Henriot 1983, Csíkszentmihályi 1996, Brougère 2005, Calleja 2011, Kapp 2013, Caïra 2018) et s’appuiera en particulier sur les travaux de Goffman portant soit directement sur le jeu (Fun in Games 1961) soit sur les outils conceptuels des cadres de l’expérience (1974) et nourrit de réflexions récentes produites par l’analyse des situations (De Fornel 2000)Ce travail exploratoire posera tout d’abord les bases du contexte social particulier qu’est la soirée jeu, et en particulier de l’importance de ces soirées dans les formes de participations de la communauté de pratique (Wenger 1998) et des liens qu’elles tissent avec les autres pratiques et réifications de cette même communauté. La thèse s’attardera ensuite sur le déroulement d’une partie et le détail des différents éléments structurants qui la constituent. Ce sera l’occasion de produire une description des aspects sociotechniques du dispositif ludique que constituent les jeux d’édition, et de s’intéresser à la façon dont les règles de la conversation ordinaire s’inscrivent dans le cadre d’une ratique de jeu. La dernière partie de la thèse vise à répondre à cette problématique de l’engagement ludique. En s’appuyant tout d’abord sur les discours normatifs tant sur les comportements attendus en jeu que sur les jeux eux-mêmes, pour en souligner l’importance donnée dans ces discours aux problématiques de l’engagement dans le jeu. Pour suivre sur l’étude des situations où cet engagement est soit menacé soit entretenu, construit et favorisé par les joueurs. Ce faisant, la thèse démontre comment différentes formes d’engagement ludique forment autant de ressources permettant de maintenir la rencontre ludique à travers notamment des mécanismes de transformations et de modalisation des cadres, et la mobilisation de particularité et ressources propres aux jeux, aux pratiques communautaires et à la conversation elle-même.},

  abstract = {Modern role-playing games are a recent chapter in a long history of role-playing and game-playing. What ramifications do these role-playing games have for the individuals and groups that play them? What possibilities do they contain for human liberation? This thesis attempts to answer these questions through a combination of historical and philosophical inquiry. I ground this thesis in recent historical scholarship on the origin and development of role-playing games, namely the work on Dungeons \& Dragons by Jon Peterson. I combine this historical scholarship with the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bernard Suits, and C. Thi Nguyen to establish a theoretical philosophical grounding with which to understand the nature of role-playing and of games in general. These two disciplines of scholarship, along with some sociological and anthropological work, inform my approach to the topic of role-playing games and liberation. I analyze these games with respect to three issues: individual agency, narrative storytelling and community formation, and the culture industry. I argue for the liberatory potential of role-playing games on all three counts. These games enhance a sense of agential fluidity which allows players to better understand themselves and each another, helping to liberate people from narrow-mindedness with regard to identity. The narrative storytelling and consequent community formation within these games establishes a space where people can interact with others in a non-capitalized manner, and some (but not all) of these games can allow for a process of resisting the influence of capital and the culture industry though a direct imagining of alternatives to capitalism. I argue role-playing games can aid in a process of depicting ways to liberate humanity from capitalist domination, both through their structural features of agency and community formation and through the act of directly depicting social alternatives to the world of capitalism.},

  abstract = {Despite the prevalence of Fantasy Role Playing Games (FRPGs) in North American society, and the concern over the possible negative side effects that such games may have on their players, empirical research dealing with Fantasy Role Playing is quite lacking. The characteristics of players of FRPGs were compared to non-players through the administration of measures of psychopathology (TSC-40, RSE), dissociation (DES), IQ (Shipley's Institute of Living Scale), imagery ability (Absorption, Betts Imagery Vividness, PPI (XT)), fantasy proneness (ICMI), and hypnotizability (CURSS:O). FRPG subjects (n = 45) and control subjects (n = 45) were found to be indistinguishable by scores on psychopathology measures. FRPG players were found, however, to have elevated IQ, Absorption, Fantasy Proneness, and Temporal Lobe Lability scores. While hypnotic susceptibility was not found to differentiate the groups, Absorption, Frequency of FRPG play, and Number of FRPG systems experienced, were found to significantly predict hypnotic susceptibility within the FRPG group. The presence of the gaming variables as significant predictors shows variance in susceptibility not explained through imagery ability, nor other established predictors in the literature. Factor analysis suggests that involvement in FRPGs is less a correlate of imagery ability than it is of a tendency towards fantasy.},

  abstract = {Tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) play involves complex social interactions and imaginative processes. These recursive elements cause players to evaluate and reevaluate the identities of themselves and the identities of their imagined characters. Previous research has established that TRPG play unwittingly allows players to rehearse social interactions and potential self-identities. Explorations such as these can be desirable to educators trying to give students a critical outlook on identity and perspective. This study presents a novel survey of Discord users from communities with the goal of understanding players’ awareness and experience with these identity-making processes. Nineteen experienced TRPG players responded to the survey and their responses were segmented, coded, and analyzed using a constructivist approach. The resulting themes show that players do frequently use TRPG play as an opportunity to explore alternative perspectives and identities. Players reported exploring various moral and social outlooks, as well as genders and sexualities that differ from their own. These explorations happen dynamically, with players initially creating characters with varying degrees of similarity to themselves and reevaluating this similarity as their identity or their character’s identity changes over time. TRPGs have potential as tools in the college composition classroom as a way of giving students a critical outlook of identity and the perspectives of themselves and others. Additionally, TRPGs can be a way of approaching these and other topics in a way that feels politically neutral and unobtrusive.},

  abstract = {The suspension of disbelief is integral to the performing arts. We ask our actors to see couches made of three chairs, designers to create cities in empty spaces, and most of all; we ask audiences to believe the stories and relationships that are figurative and often abstract. This level of critical and creative engagement is assumed to develop in spaces of higher education. However, with an ever-changing world and increasing conversions and integrations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in spaces of higher education, it has become even more apparent that students need to develop their creative and critical thinking skills earlier on in their development. By recontextualizing learning through imaginative immersive game systems, such as Dungeons \& Dragons and similar tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), I have found that students experience categories of significant learning synergistically through experiential gameplay. This immersive storytelling relies entirely on the player-performers to spend their disbelief and immerse themselves in their imagination, termed theatre of the mind. The gamification of role- play acts as a means of challenging students to activate their development of collaborative improv, storytelling/playwriting, and dramaturgy skills. Through research and play testing, I have developed a gamified drama-focused role-play educational tool utilizing many of the core gameplay mechanics in the world’s most popular TTRPGs. In this thesis, I present the game structure and reflect upon my experiences implementing this work. Additionally, I explore the cross sections between game design and immersive theatre practice and consider how this intersection is utilized in gamified performance and pedagogy. Finally, I consider how a theatre- of-the-mind-based pedagogy can be utilized in subjects outside of the theatre classroom.},

  abstract = {Role-play is an established tool in psychotherapy. Recent literature has indicated the similarities between live action role-playing (larp) and psychotherapy. In cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is one of the most widespread therapeutic approaches, Role-play is a tool for developing desired target behavior (Fliegel 2020). This also applies to so-called skills groups in CBT. One form of these skills groups is the Gruppentraining sozialer Kompetenzen (Hinsch et al. 2015). Some literature has highlighted the similarities between role-playing methods used in CBT-oriented skills groups and larp (Aschenbrenner 2013, Balzer 2008). A deficit in social skills is associated with a variety of mental disorders (Segrin 2001). The use of a CBT-oriented larp may therefore be helpful in the treatment of several mental disorders. A standardised form of CBT-oriented larp in the sense of a clinical manual does not yet exist. There is also no empirical evaluation with questionnaires of such a therapeutic larp yet. This article presents the implementation and empirical evaluation of a standardised CBT-oriented larp. This clinical case study was conducted with 6 patients with mental disorders.Participants were aged 30 years or younger and all had at least one affective disorder. Established clinical screening questionnaires were used for assessment. Data were collected in a pre-post follow-up design. The study shows that this CBT-oriented larp is feasible with people with mental illness. Qualitative data show good goal attainment and positive experiences among participants. Short-term positive developments were also found in the screenings. However, an empirical statement about the effectiveness of the larp is not yet possible; in the long term, the screenings even show negative trends. Participants were aged 30 years or younger and all had at least one affective disorder. Established clinical screening questionnaires were used for assessment. Data were collected in a pre-post follow-up design. The study showed that a CBT-oriented larp has positive effects on mental health, especially in the short term, and can be an effective component of conventional behavioral therapy in the long term.},

  abstract = {The contrast between work and play as activities collapses if play is seen, following anthropologist Thomas Malaby, as a disposition towards the indeterminate. Once play is positioned as a state of mind, activities that constitute work need not be disjunct from playful behavior. Yet for most workers, work is rarely if ever playful, and attempts to import play behavior into the workplace (‘gamification’) do not result in greater playfulness. Part of this problem results from specific aesthetic values for games having dominated both work and play. As Roger Caillois warned half a century ago, sport-like values have increasingly saturated the culture of the overdeveloped world. Meanwhile, gamification processes have only been able to export task-focussed reward structures from the domain of play – practices that descend from Dungeons \& Dragons, but that have been denuded of their playful qualities. In parallel to the gamification of work has been the gamification of games, namely an increasing emphasis on tasks to structure video game play (e.g., achievements), and thus make them more compelling yet less playful. In so much as this entails forcing particular patterns of understanding onto both players and workers, this makes gamification a parallel to Jacques Rancière's stultification in education: a binding of wills instead of an emancipation. If we want a world where work could be more playful, we must begin by breaking the cultural dominance of sport-like and task-like aesthetics of play, and endeavour to overcome the underlying fears that prevent work from being played.},

While ‘playing with’ usually refers to the specific objects used as toys and ‘playing at’ to the roles assumed in such play, examining play situations from the perspective of the make-believe theory of representation (prop theory) suggests a specific relationship between these two aspects of playing. By examining which props are being used in any given play situation, and comparing their metaphorical position in the foreground or background of the imaginary game being played, parallels and distinctions between different kinds of play can be explored and contrasted. The paper offers a phenomenology of imaginative play that helps to clarify exactly what we are playing with when we engage in any kind of imaginings, whether with toys, games, or stories.},

Among the player base in the D\&D community are those that gleaned its potential to offer a conducive space for personal growth, particularly in the realm of psychosocial development, given that D\&D sessions facilitated dynamic social interactions among the members. The emphasis on imagination in D\&D nurtures the tenets of intermodal expression, as players are encouraged to explore their creativity through the embodiment of their character in addition to engaging in the fictional play-space, which appeals to such concepts in expressive arts therapy as in expanding the range of play by decentering into an alternative reality or alternative world experience. This literature review desired to address the gap in literature analyzing D\&D as a creative tool for social skills development, especially for adolescents who are in the process of cultivating their unique personalities. Recommendations for utilizing this method in a therapeutic setting were provided in addition to a fully conceptualized outline for a ten-week group curriculum which may act as a springboard for inspiring future endeavors in incorporating D\&D roleplay with the selected population.},

As such, this study conducted an in-depth examination of the elements of TRPGs through the perception of players. Self-determination theory helped frame the study, while the Generic Qualitative Inquiry approach was used for the methodology. Semi structured interviews were conducted with six participants. Data revealed several themes that aligned with the motivational frame related to competency, relatedness, and autonomy. The findings indicate the importance of the roleplaying element and the connection between the player and their in-game character, as well as the effect choices within the game have on the players and other elements of TRPGs. Implications regarding design of TRPGs as learning tools are discussed.},

I extend the research on larp subcultures in two ways. First, I place larping within the larger context of leisure subcultures and society by arguing that larping is representative of changes in leisure and subcultures in postmodern society. Second, I draw upon ethnographic data collected among the New England Role-playing Organization (NERO) to analyze larpers character identity performances. RPG and Larp researchers have developed several theories about the relationship between larp participants and their character performances. While these concepts provide a helpful framework for understanding the participant-character relationship, they undertheorize the in-game constructed performance of identity. Using symbolic interaction theory, I analyze the identity work processes larpers use to construct and perform their larp identities extending our understanding of the similarities between everyday identity and larpers' character identity performances.},

The players utilize identity typifications, construct characters, and manage costuming and appearance to create fantasy identities situated in a role play environment. This role play environment is also one of multiple realities with borders that must be symbolically managed by participants so as to separate the fantasy frame from that of the everyday frame. Players engage in various aspects of border work and border blending while navigating the world between these frames.},

By leveraging the passion and engagement fostered within geek communities, this theory proposes a distinctive avenue for psychological intervention. It explores the prospect of channeling the intrinsic motivation and communal dynamics prevalent in geek culture to enact meaningful and positive changes in individuals' behaviors.

The game is played by a group of players, each of whom takes on the role of a character in a fantasy world. The players work together to complete quests, overcome obstacles, and defeat monsters while a "Dungeon Master" (DM) manages the story and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using D\&amp;D and other tabletop RPGs as a form of mental health therapy. This is because the game can provide a safe and supportive environment for players to explore and express their emotions, work on personal issues, and build social skills. Tabletop RPGs can help foster personal growth in several ways: Problem-solving, Decision-Making, Emotional Intelligence, Communication, Creativity, Self-Esteem, and even Confidence. Mental health professionals have begun incorporating Tabletop RPGs into their sessions as a way to engage their clients in a fun and interactive way and it should be used in conjunction with other forms of treatment.},

Merritt and Andre Norton, a dark fantasy comic by Gardner Fox \& John Giunta, and illustrations by revered master of the weird, Virgil Finlay, and Escape The Dark Castle's Alex Crispin. Drawing upon the original list of “inspirational reading” provided by Gary Gygax in the first Dungeon Master's Guide, published in 1979, as well as hobbyist magazines and related periodicals that helped to define the modern role-playing game, Appendix N offers a collection of short fiction and resonant fragments that reveal the literary influences that shaped Dungeons \& Dragons, the world's most popular RPG.

  abstract = {Tabletop games such a Dungeons \& Dragons allow players the ability to create a make belief world in which other players can be a part of. Tabletop games mainly depend on the players imagination, which is both its greatest feature and flaw. The frustration comes with not having shared vision for the word, so players typically buy figurines and maps. Our solution is an app that uses augmented reality to bring tabletop gaming to life. Players will be able to view the characters and maps of their story in a more interactive and immersive way. As players view the game from their phone camera, they will be able to see 3D trees, dragons, and their own personalized characters standing on the table, swaying and breathing as if they were in the room with them. Parties can be built to allow friends who are also playing the game to be able to see the same objects from their own distinct perspective. Not only do they have the option to choose through a selection of provided 3D models, but also be able to upload their own 3D models to view in the real world through their phone cameras.},

  abstract = {This paper explores how deep realism in Tabletop Roleplaying Games can facilitate emotional introspection, community-building, a reclamation of agency, and a reaffirmation of the players’ own positive traits as reflected in their character roleplay. Deep realism is the practice of building the details of a real environment into a game world to make the world recognizable to the players. This idea was investigated using the TTRPG system Outbreak:UNDEAD, a zombie apocalypse and survival simulation game where players have the option to take a personality test to create characters of themselves in the game. I designed a module for the system using the principles of deep realism and the setting of a real college in Massachusetts as its location. I ran this module for players from the school, who portrayed themselves as characters navigating an apocalyptic scenario set in a fictionalized version of their college campus and home. The goal of this study was to better understand how deep realism can be used to encourage agency when it is limited in the real world, how it affects locational and character bleed (Hugaas, 2022), and how it can support personal and community growth. During this “positive-negative experience" (Montola, 2010), I observed and recorded participant actions, which were subsequently analyzed alongside responses provided during reflective post-game interviews. Emphasizing deep realism allowed me to facilitate an experience of heightened bleed, encouraging players to actively explore their identities outside of and within the game world. Creating a safe and familiar gameplay environment empowers players to retain agency amidst adversity, experience “perezhivanie” (Schmit, 2016) which carries outside of the game space, and forge deeper connections within a supportive community setting.},

  abstract = {Whereas role-playing and table-top role-play games (RPGs) have been proven to have potential as therapeutic tools, playing RPGs is often stereotypically associated with social incompetence and psychiatric disorders. Knowledge regarding the stereotype and its implications is very scarce specifically among mental health practitioners. Therefore the present study aimed to narrow this gap in knowledge by examining the perception of Social Workers that are considered to be the forefront of mental health-care, in regard to the association between playing RPGs and mental health. A convenience sample of 130 Social Workers, recruited through social networks (e.g. Facebook, WhatsApp etc.), responded to an on-line survey dealing with their perception of their own knowledge on RPGs, the importance of such knowledge and the association between playing RPGs and mental illness. Results indicated an association between having higher knowledge of RPGs and lower perception of a link between playing RPGs and psychopathology. The study's findings emphasize the false stigma and its potential harmful implication on professionals' practice, especially in the context of intake process and primary diagnostic. The effect of familiarity is also discussed in light of the study's findings. HIGHLIGHTS: • The perception of mental health professionals toward role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons is understudied. • Social Workers' perception was measured in regard to the connection between use of RPGs and DSM-IV-TR psychopathology. • Greater knowledge of RPGs was found to be associated with lower perception of the connection between use of RPGs and DSM-IV-TR psychopathology.},

The purpose of this analysis is to criticize how there is a lack of modern-day adult male figures to look up to in the US. In this alternate male role model, which the game presents, the characters can develop a masculine gender performance, in contexts that have absent parental figures. In analyzing these texts, I utilize a focus on gender studies, with a combination of class theory from the works of Marx and Foucault and Borderlands theory from the work of Anzaldua. Each text provides characters who must face obstacles, related to these theoretical approaches, and the project focuses on how they must face these without a male role model to guide them. The tabletop role playing game provides a fantasy space that allows for the  adolescent boys in these two texts, to experience heroic action, and have a model to become men.},

While scholarly research has consistently found that women are marginalized in these communities, little research has looked at how men see these communities. Research on homosociality shows that men use communities and relationships with other men to access masculinity (Bird, 1996; Dellinger, 2004; Houston, 2012). Building on game studies and masculinity studies, this research looks at the way men in tabletop roleplaying game communities understand their involvement and the ways their involvement connects with masculinity. Tabletop gaming communities give men access to a form of masculinity they may be denied, primarily by providing access to other ways of building social capital and relationships with other men.},

Using Dungeons and Dragons as the ubiquitous example of a TTRPG that operates on foundations of hierarchy, coloniality, and violence, I consider the reframing of discourses that their designers achieve through how they structure character and world creation and player interaction. These games exemplify counter-hegemonic, decolonial practices of game design and play by undoing the player-gamemaster hierarchy, changing the apparatuses that mediate in-game and out-of-game discourses, and increasing the value of lived experience and subject positionalities for players and characters. Collaborative processes and structures that increase player agency and relationship-building shift the objectives of gameplay from conquest and domination to building a mutually satisfying narrative and emphasizing the value of empowering and uplifting other players. I’ll also be attentive to the structure of Dream Askew and Wanderhome in my primary analysis, taking inspiration from their configurations as a conversation and a journey, respectively. Through considering these games as attending to a broader range of experiences and reimagining game design for a more inclusive audience, I position them as examples that can inspire game designers to consider the discourse their games enact and TTRPG players to recognize what a game’s structures restrict or enable in their play experience.},

  abstract = {This qualitative dissertation explores the use of an original table-top role-playing game as a framework for community-building among independent community educators who lack a central geographic nexus. The study utilized an action research approach, involving the creation and development of the game in collaboration with participants for a period of many months, using an iterative, emergent design process that emphasized collaboration and feedback. The research sought to answer the following questions: 1) How can a table-top role-playing game establish and build community among independent community educators? 2) By engaging in an emergent design-informed table-top role-playing game, what kinds of community-building frameworks can be produced by independent community educators playing the game? The game, called "New School," was designed to facilitate communication and connection among educators working in a variety of communities, contexts, and geographic locations. Through a series of playtesting sessions and a reflective feedback loop, the researcher and participants identified key features of the game that supported community-building, including opportunities for storytelling, shared problem-solving, and connection with personal and professional experiences. The findings suggest that the game has potential to serve as a framework for community-building, promoting emergent collaboration and knowledge-sharing among participants. Implications for future research and practice in this area are discussed.},

Bringing together game texts and scraped social media data from reactionary D\&D fans, I argue that despite cursory improvements in official representation, D\&D's hostility to trans play is inscribed in the game's engagement of fantasy realism—a culturally sculpted “common sense” that rearticulates the logics of established fantasy media. From sex-swap curses in Gygax's “Tomb of Horrors” (1978) to the shapechanging “blessed elves of Corellon” (2017), D\&D's approach to fantasy realism mechanically and narratively excludes trans bodies, vilifies trans stories, and diminishes trans power. Drawing on the work of analog game and trans media scholars, I use this case study to center trans power in tabletop gaming and explore D\&D's relationship with fantasy realism by asking Whose fantasy? and Whose reality?},

  abstract = {The connection that players can feel toward their characters in pen-and-paper roleplaying games is a known phenomenon that has been previously studied and is recognized among roleplaying enthusiasts. Pen-and-paper roleplaying games are a complex form of games, with three distinct frames which are ludological, social, and diegetic (also called narrative). The frames are different aspects of the game as well as the base of different motivations for players, who value the frames in a varied degree. The goal of this thesis is to examine if in-game choices based on the diegetic frame in contrast to the ludological frame are correlated with the player/character connection. The method used for data collection is distribution of a quantitative questionnaire on the internet, spread to Swedish roleplayers through social media and associations tied to SVEROK. With their answers, the analysis identifies correlations between the player/character connection and the three frames of pen-and-paper roleplaying games, as well as other correlations noted in the data analysis. The literature revolves around the two core concepts; the player/character connection and the three frames of roleplaying games. The result shows that diegetic choices in contrast to ludological are weakly correlated with the player/character connection.},

  abstract = {The essay aims to propose the diagrammatic structure of the megadungeon as a metaphor to represent the complexity, interconnectedness, and multi-layered nature of the current media scenario, including its active branches such as new media art and Digital Humanities. The reference is drawn from the concept of the dungeon, which has been successfully introduced into the realm of role-playing games since the 1970s. Conventionally, a dungeon refers to a complex, multi-level maze of corridors, tunnels, rooms, and hidden chambers. The nature of dungeons is to be theoretically infinite floor plans that game designers have learned to produce algorithmically: when they cross a certain size threshold, they are known as megadungeons. In this article, I propose the megadungeon as a productive topological model that intersects different sociotechnical aspects of digital media, drawing on shared characteristics such as a layered structure, labyrinthine exploration, game-derived grammar, and an affinity with computational domain. Additionally, the essay proposes comparisons with similar representation models that challenge outdated cartographic metaphors and addresses specific connections between new media and the concepts of verticality and stratification.},

  abstract = {This article examines West End Games’ Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, first published in 1987, and its foundational role in the worldbuilding process of the Star Wars franchise (1977–). In producing the game, West End Games contributed significantly to defining and organizing the storyworld, refining and expanding the scope of Star Wars by integrating some earlier transmedial extensions while excluding others. Coming at an early point in the franchise’s history, before Lucasfilm exerted as much control over its licensees, The Roleplaying Game offers an opportunity to examine the role that licensed game designers can play as architects and gatekeepers of transmedia worldbuilding, codifying what is and is not remembered within the storyworld. The Roleplaying Game has often been reduced to a footnote in both the popular and academic history of Star Wars transmedia, but beyond adapting the Galaxy Far, Far Away to a setting for imaginative tabletop roleplaying, The Roleplaying Game is also a foundational document for the last three decades of the Star Wars franchise, serving as the early ‘story bible’ for the Expanded Universe, the interconnected network of Star Wars paratexts codified by the licensing department of Lucasfilm during the 1990s. The hundreds of Star Wars novels, comics, games and other transmedia productions that came with the franchise’s dramatic rebirth in the 1990s bear the stamp of the worldbuilding labour of West End Games.},

  abstract = {Licensed games—analog or digital games that are made under contract using pre-existing intellectual properties—bring together the narrative trajectories of their storyworld, the production histories of their creation, the affective traces of their fandoms, and the interpersonal dynamics of their play. This dissertation examines the intersection of the industrial practices of licensing, the textual properties of transmediality, and the creative process of worldbuilding through the lens of licensed games. Licensed games have frequently been dismissed as derivative and overly commercial; my aim is to embrace the redundancies and contradictions of licensed games. Licensing, in which owners of intellectual property sell the rights for use of an IP for a limited period, provides the framework but not the boundaries of these ludic paratexts that stage a complex negotiation of popular storyworlds and fannish affect.     In this dissertation, I explore how three different popular storyworlds are built and shared, explored and negotiated, experienced and felt. The first chapter examines how games have contributed to the growth and continuation of the Star Wars universe. In the second chapter, I survey how the design of rules in games based on the A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones franchise inflects and influences engagement with Westeros. And in my final chapter, I explore what I call a post-licensed game, Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, and the frequently fraught communal process of supporting a card game once its licensing and production have ended.     These licensed games provide richly textured case studies of the negotiation between industrial stakeholders, texts, and fans. Utilizing a combination of textual analysis, participant observation and interviews with players, I argue that licensed games are a fertile medium through which popular brands, franchises, and storyworlds are productively transmediated. How these games draw upon the subjective and affective dimensions of our investment in popular storyworlds reveals much about game design, media franchising, and the creative processes of worldbuilding inherent to both. Licensed games allow us to play in a storyworld, and their modes of engagements foreground the playful ways we experience and understand the transmedially expansive franchises that dominate popular culture.},

In a typical setting, a party of skilled adventurers engages on a dungeon crawl aligned along a common goal to beat the competition and to find and uncover enormous riches that wait out there—sounds familiar, you mean, to your daily work in business or R\&D?

Made widely accessible by the Digital Age, these sprawling story worlds include massively multiplayer online games, comic book superhero ‘universes’ composed of multiple lms as well as print and web content, role-playing games like Dungeons \& Dragons, and grand television serials with expansive and intermingling storylines. Vast narratives are affected by a number of forces that challenge traditional aesthetic criticism, including collaborative authorship, sprawling and polymorphous plotlines, real-time fan feedback, proliferation of ofcial and unofcial associated materials available through TV and the web, and the economic exigencies of digital media production, all of which are endishly difcult to render legible enough to include in a close reading. © 2018 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Background. Gamers with poor self-concept, high social anxiety, and high loneliness are more at risk of problematic involvement in videogames and particularly in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) than other players. There is a research gap concerning treatment approaches to cater socially anxious gamers with problematic patterns of gaming involvement. This registered exploratory pilot tests the feasibility and initial effect of a structured protocol in which socially anxious online gamers are exposed in offline social skills and exposed to real-life social interactions while playing an offline tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). Methods. Our structured protocol lasts 10 weeks and involves 10 sessions organized within 3 modules in which participants play a TTRPG inspired from the game “Dungeons and Dragons”. Each module deploys a written role-playing scenario designed to challenge the players in game terms, as well as to involve them in a story based on maturing relationships with other characters and on solving challenges by social means and investigation. Our study uses an experimental multiple single-case design with multiple baselines across groups (4 groups of 5 gamers with sub-clinical problematic videogame use and social anxiety) and a 3-month follow-up. Outcomes assessed include social skills, selfesteem, loneliness, assertiveness, and gaming disorder symptoms. Results. Ethical clearance has been obtained. Data collection is planned to begin on April 1, 2023 and to end in November 2023. Conclusion. Our proof-of-principle study is intended to provide pilot data for use in developing new types of interventions which, given their game-based social nature, may be more accessible and engaging for persons with problematic involvement in online videogames and concomitant social anxiety.},

L’intervention a duré 10 semaines divisée en 10 séances hebdomadaire organisées en 3 modules de difficulté progressive. Notre étude pilote a utilisé un modèle quasi-expérimental à cas unique avec une ligne de base de 3 semaines au sein de 4 groupes de 5 joueur·euse·s et un suivi de 3 mois. Dix-huit des 20 participant·e·s inclus·e·s ont terminé l'ensemble du programme et 17 des 20 participant·e·s inscrit·e·s ont terminé le suivi. Les analyses ont montré qu'un sous-groupe de participant·e·s a bénéficié de l'intervention via une réduction de symptômes d’anxiété sociale et de jeu problématique, bien que la taille des effets pour l'ensemble du groupe soit d'une ampleur faible ou faible à moyenne. Notre étude pilote montre que l’intervention est faisable et peut être utilisée pour réduire l'anxiété sociale et les symptômes de jeu problématique. Le programme va maintenant être testé auprès de participant·e·s cliniques. En marge de la présentation de cette étude, un atelier pratique sera proposé aux personnes intéressées ayant assistées à la conférence. Cet atelier proposera d’illustrer notre démarche via des exercices interactifs et une approche expérientielle.

  abstract = {Answering the call of social justice movements, in particular Black Lives Matter marches, to critically appraise power structures that shape how we live, role-playing game designers, both in live-action role-playing (larp) and tabletop, have responded by casting a critical lens on the narrative systems that shape how we play. Just as these movements have challenged enduring inequalities that limit the realization of minority members’ agency in the public domain, many new games insist that it is not merely troubling content that may give people pause from engaging in the role-playing hobby. Rather, many of these games reconsider the structure of conventional play itself, in which one individual holds asymmetrical power to influence the narrative, echoing other asymmetrical (and even unjust) hierarchies at large in society. These games demonstrate that this central figure is not necessary for evocative play and a group’s imaginative capabilities. Games without a Game Master, “GMless'' games, often aim to expand avenues of creative input and liberate a table from the aegis of a single member’s directorial aesthetics. This essay claims that social justice movements have had an influence on the outpouring of GMless game designs in the last half-decade. Further, this essay identifies several conventional responsibilities associated with the role of the Game Master, illustrating how a variety of published GMless designs in~both, larps and TRPGs,~reimagine, remix, and reincorporate these responsibilities, making possible more egalitarian and—for many—more welcoming roleplaying experiences.},

  abstract = {The digital age has seen an unprecedented proliferation of literary content across different media, involving different audiences. As a consequence of this, scholars are directing their attention to how literature lives on beyond the book. While much of this research focuses on forms of intermediality, less attention has been given to embodied, participatory and interactive practices where literature is used in a variety of ways. In this chapter, we will discuss what happens to literature when it is used in physical, collaborative gameplay, focusing on live action role playing (larp), specifically larps in the Nordic tradition.                      Since larp is located at the intersection of a number of different cultural expressions, we draw on scholarly work on gaming, performance, adaptation and participatory culture to discuss how literary material is used in three different larps, at which we have carried out fieldwork. Fortune and Felicity (2017) engaged with all of Jane Austen’s work, taking place over five days in period costume and setting. Located at the actual Elsinore Castle, Inside Hamlet (2017) adapted Shakespeare’s play to a revolutionary, decadent context. Using Thomas Vinterberg’s film The Celebration as the frame story, A Nice Evening With the Family (2018) thematised bourgeois family trauma through the use of a number of nineteenth-century Scandinavian plays, like Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House.                      Although thematically diverse, these larps raise common questions: What happens when a literary storyworld is materialised in embodied practices such as live action role playing? How can the unfolding story be understood collectively and individually and what storytelling mechanisms are used? What does it feel like to embody characters and actions from a work of fiction? By addressing these questions, this chapter highlights the intricate relation between literature and its collective embodiment in larp.},

  abstract = {Live-action role-playing (larp) is characterized by participants’ physical and mental immersion in a storyworld, played out in a specific location during a fixed period of time. Most of the immersion is realized during the live event itself, where a collective story is acted out in physical space in real time. However, contemporary larping also usually entails significant interaction and communication between players, and between players and organisers, before and after the event itself, through digital media. In this article, we explore the social media afterlife of one of the most significant Nordic larp events in recent years, Fortune and Felicity (2017). Using an affordance framework, we discuss what happens to the “liveness” of the larp when it is extended into social media. Through the affordances of persistence, visibility, editability and associability, we analyse material from the Facebook group connected to Fortune and Felicity, used by players and organisers to prepare for the larp and, afterwards, to continue the gameplay and to de-brief. In social media, the continuum of time and space, which is characteristic of the larp event itself, is changed into asynchronous and physically separate player action. Thus, the affordances of social media, we argue, enable player interaction and collaborative storytelling in ways that change the narrative, interactive and immersive dynamics of the larp.},

While there are many approaches to acquiring knowledge about RPGs, designers of RPGs often consider the structural elements of a game—its rules and the entities on which the rules act—and how they will interact with each other. The Roleplaying Game is based on George Lucas’ Star Wars movie and its sequels. The benefits can be varied: name or brand recognition might mean there is an audience ready for a game. The rules of an RPG often direct players on how to approach playing it (e.g., seriously, competitively, or humorously). Having described broadly some of the challenges faced by RPG designers, the chapter will focus on three broad areas in the design space of RPGs through the lens of design patterns. Originally introduced in architecture by Christopher Alexander and others, design patterns capture common, reoccurring solutions to common, reoccurring problems in a design domain.},

  abstract = {This master thesis investigates the use of role-playing games (RPGs), specifically Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D), as a teaching method for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) within the Norwegian LK20 curriculum framework. The study is grounded in the educational theories of Vygotsky, Bandura, and Bakhtin, emphasizing the significance of social interaction and observational learning. Through an observational study involving 7th-grade students, the research explores the impact of RPGs on vocabulary acquisition, student engagement, and interaction quality.    The findings reveal that RPGs can significantly enhance student engagement and provide a dynamic environment for practicing language skills. Students actively used and expanded their vocabulary in meaningful contexts during the role-playing sessions, demonstrating the method's potential to facilitate language learning. The study also identifies challenges such as the need for teacher preparation.    The literature review complements the observational study by analysing previous research on the educational use of RPGs, highlighting their benefits and limitations. Despite the challenges, the integration of RPGs into EFL education shows promise. It suggests that with proper planning and implementation, RPGs can be a valuable tool for language learning in Norwegian classrooms. This thesis contributes to the academic discourse on innovative teaching methods and offers practical insights for educators seeking to enhance EFL instruction through engaging and interactive pedagogies.},

Dungeons \& Dragons, le plus ancien des jeux de rôle, a 50 ans en 2024. À cette occasion, le Fonds Patrimonial du Jeu de Société (FPJS) mets à l’honneur dans une exposition inédite sa collection Jeu de rôle pour rendre hommage à ces cinq décennies de créations ludiques et esthétiques. C’est dans le cadre de cet événement que la bibliothèque universitaire Edgar Morin a reçu William Blanc pour un nouveau café thématique consacré au Moyen-Âge imaginaire dans les jeux de rôle, plus particulièrement dans l’histoire de Donjons et Dragons. William Blanc est historien. Après ses études consacrées à l’histoire du Moyen Âge à l’université Paris 1 puis à l’EHESS, ses recherches portent aujourd’hui principalement sur les représentations contemporaines du Moyen Âge (le médiévalisme), que ce soit dans les usages politiques et sociaux ou bien dans la culture populaire (BD, cinéma, jeux, séries télévisées, arts graphiques) thème auquel il a consacré plusieurs ouvrages, seul ou en collaboration. Il écrit aussi des articles de vulgarisation sur ses champs de recherches, notamment pour les magazines L’Histoire, Historia, la BNF, Retronews ou la chaîne YouTube Nota Bene.

  abstract = {In recent years, several publications have emerged that attempt to generate a framework for the application of neurocognitive knowledge to solve social problems. Under the moniker of "behavioral sciences", this field of studies, which presents itself as profoundly interdisciplinary, aims to provide tools to solve various social problems by elucidating the mechanisms underlying human behavior and their subsequent operationalization in the form of public policies. We focus our attention on certain epistemological and ideological aspects that underlie these initiatives, in particular their conceptualization of the climate crisis as a problem to be solved through advances in the cognitive sciences. We observe, exemplify and problematize a series of premises: the behavior of the individual as the terminal expression of an "internal" process in which the environment and by extension the "social" are subordinated in terms of their explanatory hierarchy; the simplification of the problems to be solved in terms of cognitive biases and limitations, so that the objectives of the intervention are the behaviors and decisions of individual actors; the appeal to biology as explanatory support for the psychological constructs used through adaptationist narratives on the development of innate cognitive functionalities. We maintain that the generation and application of knowledge in this kind of initiatives is inscribed in a sharp ideological line, according to which the main causes of the climate crisis are not to be found in the dynamics and contradictions of the current socioeconomic system, but in those of individual cognitive systems.},

Roleplaying has also evolved its own special set of superstitions, myths, and folklore. Most of this is superstition related to dice and the other materials of gaming, mixed in with a collection of popular culture references.},

Finding understanding requires the will to dissect your own knowledge.  Nearly all writers on larp are avid larpers them selves. This makes the process of finding understanding a lot more difficult than most people outside the field would think. Larp can at its best be intensely emotional and inspirational, even a defining element of ones life. At its worst larp’s just boring. Getting to understand larp demands that the writer is willing to cast aside the fondness they feel for their subject, to evaluate the failures and boring bits. You cannot dissect without taking your subject apart. This is the dissection, here are their findings. This is the third collection of articles for Knutepunkt, the annual Scandinavian Congress on Larp. It is our hope that this book will establish a tradition of an annual book compromising articles on larp. The two former works, As Larp Grows Up, and Beyond Role and Play set the standard for us. Hopefully, we have not put them to shame.},

The author also mentions (but not go deep into) the fact that the setting and plot of a particular larp also can be classified in the same manner. In the commentary, the editors point out that the terminology predates the article, and wonders how the theory can be brought forward towards connecting larp writing and playing.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of the early UK specialist gaming press and charts how these vanguard texts helped initiate, and articulate, an emergent gamer culture, specifically in terms of producing a distinctly adolescent gaming aesthetic from pre-existing Fantasy and Sci-Fi tropes. Textually orientated discourse analysis is combined with content analysis to examine the illustrations used in over 100 magazines, both in terms of their cover pages and advertising content, in order to establish and examine their dominant tropes. Findings show the imagery used on the magazines prioritised certain themes and identities whilst excluding others. As such these texts acted as sites of masculine role-play, with idealised bodies and minds set within a network of fetishistic Fantasy and hi-tech environs. Crucially, these images would provide gamers with a diegetic bridge into the new game worlds they represented.},

  abstract = {Since 1974, Dungeons \&amp; Dragons (D\&amp;D) has existed on the fringes of popular culture alongside many other tabletop roleplaying games. In recent years, however, D\&amp;D and other RPGs have emerged at the forefront of gaming culture. The allure of fantasy and magic draws players into creating and roleplaying characters in a mediated fantasy space through social interaction. Though largely untheorized, Dungeons \&amp; Dragons has been examined through sociological and philosophical lenses, though these studies often ignore the performative aspects of the game itself.During gameplay, Dungeon Masters (DMs) often exploit sensory detail, music specifically, in order to encourage roleplay in their players. The fifth edition handbook of D\&amp;D states that DMs can use “music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they might play in the game.” The following research explores the use of music within D\&amp;D as it relates to the players’ ability to immerse themselves within the game, drawing on research in ludomusicology and applying a lens of reflexive and close ethnography. Additionally, this research explicates a growing popularity of D\&amp;D on the internet through shows such as Critical Role and the live storytelling genre, as well as how it has altered ideas concerning the performance of voice. Based on interviews with players and observations of D\&amp;D games in person and via online streaming services, this article asserts that music allows players to immerse themselves within the setting of the game, which in turn creates a form of participatory performance for both the players and the Dungeon Master.},

In particular, the use of oral storytelling and the use of folkloric artifacts within this podcast genre become key insights into how the queer community creates and performs its identity, connects its members into a cohesive community, and transmits its cultural information to both members and others. The ability of these podcasts to achieve this include how the storyteller/audience relationship is created — an extension of the oral folktale genre. In effect, the stories told by these podcasts are a key part of expressing queer identity and exploring the ways it is performed in several variations: the folk artifacts that communicate gender and sexuality, the performances of characters by their respective players, and the narrative structures created by the gaming systems themselves. To explore these elements, I examine Fast Times at D\&D High, a podcast that features a diverse cast of players — both in terms of gender identity and sexualities, as well as race — and explores the early stages of identity creation through a group of high school teens navigating their world of magic and their queerness.},

  abstract = {Customizable analog games, such as miniature games or table top role-playing games (TTRPG), rely on active engagement by consumers. Their value creation is immediately tied to not only an engaged customer base but to prosumers, who make the game “their own”. This means that business models for miniature games and TTRPGs deviate quite strongly from classic board games. Instead, inspiration can be taken from video games that allow modding and other forms of customer engagement. Similar to video games, points of monetization can vary widely from buy to rent models, leagues and tournaments, and professional work such as miniature painting for hire or paid GMs in TTRPGs. In the same way, consumers can take on different roles, from passive watchers of games to prosumers or even hobby entrepreneurs, with a fluid transition to professional work in the gaming sector. In this study, I use typologies of business and revenue models to investigate the monetization of customizable analog games from a temporal and a geographical angle. On the temporal scale, I chart the history of Games Workshop’s miniature game Warhammer 40K from Rogue Trader to a worldwide phenomenon of miniature and video games. As an example of geographically different monetization models, I rely on interviews with TTRPG creators and entrepreneurs from 17 different countries to show how the same hobby can have radically different outlooks because of different cultural or economic constraints. The aim of this study is to show how value and revenue can be created differently in customizable analog games across time and space. This investigation furthermore reveals tensions between hobby and business and between niche and mainstream entertainment.},

  abstract = {Résumé Contexte Le jeu de rôle sur table a pu montrer sa pertinence en tant que support thérapeutique par le jeu et la narration, mais est encore peu exploré dans le champ psychodynamique. Pourtant, ses caractéristiques en font une médiation particulièrement intéressante pour l’accompagnement des adolescents. Objectifs L’objectif de cet article sera de préciser les caractéristiques malléables spécifiques du jeu de rôle, et de définir comment elles relancent la symbolisation dans un contexte pathologique, mais également pour le processus de construction de l’identité. Méthode Nous nous appuierons sur les notions d’interactivité et d’intercréativité pour tenter de définir les caractéristiques du jeu de rôle, et leurs interactions avec certains des processus thérapeutiques fondamentaux. Nous puiserons dans une approche psychanalytique, mais également ludologique et narratologique pour tenter de définir les contours de cette médiation. Résultats L’interactivité et l’intercréativité influencent directement les processus d’immersion dans le jeu et la fiction, et d’identification au personnage incarné par le joueur. L’interaction entre ces différents ingrédients se révèle porteuse des processus de transformation de la subjectivité. Conclusion L’interactivité est un élément fondamental dans l’émergence de l’agentivité. Elle constitue donc un ingrédient particulièrement intéressant dans les thérapies d’adolescents. Par ailleurs, le recours à d’autres champs théoriques apparaît nécessaire pour penser un outil tel que le jeu de rôle. Context Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) have shown their relevance in play and narrative therapy. However, they have been little studied in the psychodynamic field although their characteristics make them a particularly interesting mediation in adolescents’ psychotherapy. Objectives The aim of this article is to specify the characteristics of role-playing games, and to define how they revive symbolization and the identity construction process. Method We will rely on the notions of interactivity and intercreativity to define the characteristics of TTRPG, and their interactions with some of the fundamental therapeutic processes. We will draw on a psychoanalytical approach as well as a ludological and narratological one to define this mediation. Results Interactivity and intercreativity directly influence the processes of immersion in game and fiction. They also influence identification with the character embodied by the player. The interaction between these different ingredients supports processes of psychic transformation. Conclusion Interactivity is a fundamental element in the emergence of agentivity. It is therefore a particularly interesting ingredient in adolescent therapy. Moreover, recourse to other theoretical fields appears necessary when envisioning a TTRPG psychotherapeutic mediation.},

  abstract = {Résumé Objectifs Dans la continuité de nos recherches sur la médiation par le jeu de rôle, nous nous questionnons sur les modalités d’expression du transfert, compte tenu des caractéristiques de ce médium qui mêle activité de jeu et narration collective. À cet égard, nous faisons l’hypothèse qu’il mobilise une forme spécifique de transfert, à l’origine de mouvements thérapeutiques particuliers. Patients et méthode Nous avons rencontré deux groupes d’adolescents (7~au total) dans le cadre d’une médiation thérapeutique par le jeu de rôle, menée par un psychologue et un éducateur dans une institution de scolarisation adaptée. Nous avons conçu une grille de repérage des mouvements transférentiels permettant de caractériser la nature de ces mouvements et de différencier leur scène d’émergence, entre groupe et narration. Nous avons étudié les retranscriptions de l’intégralité des séances d’atelier pour mettre en évidence les processus émergents et leur évolution de manière longitudinale. Résultats Nos résultats mettent en évidence un déploiement du transfert d’abord généralisé et marqué par des tendances massives à l’expression de l’agressivité, du déni ou du rejet de l’autre et du groupe. Au fil du temps, le mode de relation à l’objet semble évoluer, en s’appuyant sur le transfert qui s’engage avec les co-thérapeutes, et par l’intrication de ces relations aux plans actuels et narratifs. Discussion Le jeu de rôle se révèle comme un lieu de projection de la dynamique relationnelle entretenue avec l’objet, et des représentations de la relation à l’autre. Le médium révèle alors les impasses de la création du lien et de la reconnaissance de la place de l’objet, les angoisses sous-jacentes, mais il devient également un transformateur des relations, parce qu’il permet l’émergence d’un transfert d’abord diffracté dans l’enveloppe narrative, qui autorise secondairement un mouvement de reprise et un apaisement des relations de groupe. Conclusion Le jeu de rôle offre des espaces de projection qui rendent compte de la souffrance liée à la situation de rencontre avec le groupe. Il est également le lieu d’où peuvent se déployer des dynamiques relationnelles protégées de la destructivité agie grâce au prisme de la narration et d’un transfert en trois temps qui contribue au processus d’historicisation, de mise en lien. Objectives Following on from our research into mediation through role-playing games, we are investigating the ways in which transference is expressed given the characteristics of this medium which combines game activity and collective narrations. From this perspective, we hypothesize that it mobilises a specific form of transference at the origin of particular therapeutic movements. Patients and method We met with two groups of adolescents (7 adolescents altogether) in a therapeutic mediation through role-playing games, conducted by a psychologist and an educator in an adapted educational institution. We proposed a grid for identifying transference movements, making it possible to characterize the nature of these movements and to differentiate their scene of emergence between group and narrative. We studied the transcripts of all the workshop sessions to highlight the emerging processes and their evolution. Results Our results showed that the transference was initially generalised and marked by massive tendencies to express aggression, denial or rejection of the other and the group. Over time, the mode of relationship to the object seemed to evolve, drawing on the transference enabled by the psychologist and the educator and by the link between relationships at the actual and narrative levels. Discussion The role-playing game reveals itself as a place of projection of the relational dynamics and representations of the relationships. The medium then reveals the pitfall in the creation of a bond and the recognition of the object's place, and the underlying anxieties. However, it also becomes a transformer of relationships because it allows the emergence of a transference that is first diffracted in the narrative envelope, which secondly authorizes a movement of recovery and a relief of group relationships. Conclusion The role-playing game offers spaces for projection that takes account of the suffering linked to the situation of encounter within the group. It is also a place where relational dynamics can unfold, protected from the destructiveness of acting through the prism of narrative and a three-stage transfer that contributes to the process of historicization.},

A further comparison of Wizard of the Coast’s recent digital content platform for Dungeons and Dragons analyses the factors in presenting digital content necessary to encourage a “willingness to pay” in the selected audiences. A combination of a complete content catalogue, personalisation and community features, access to free content samples or tiers, and the continued improvement in service quality are all identified in Wizard of the Coast’s digital platform DnDBeyond, with an increase in physical sales following its debut.},

For Jung, active imagination is a process by which theperson engages in an awakening, creative exploration of his ownpsyche through free play of fantasy, narrative, and dialogue withdifferent “characters” representing archetypes of the collectiveunconscious. Those fantasies are usually registered as words,images, or other forms of artistic expression. Such confrontationwith one’s unconscious may lead a person to become a morebalanced and unified Self; a process known as individuation.Though observing the differences between the lonely therapeuticactivity of active imagination and the social entertaining activityof role-playing, this article postulates that Jung’s process revealsimportant insights within the nature of creativity. A role-playinggame is an interactive activity in which the players representcharacters in a narrative, having the freedom to affect fictionaccording to their creativity and choices. This article exploresthe extent to which active imagination correlates with acting inrole-playing by examining the potential for shadow work andindividuation within the structure of a game. Individuation ispossible after the engagement in a creative play, provided that theparticipants judge it a valuable process, and gain some personalinsights, by means of further reflection.},

  abstract = {To further our discussion of the didactic potential of RPGs, this chapter will discuss the basics of live action role-playing games (larp), as well as adjacent phenomena. We will consider three main larp formats: boffer, chamber, and freeform. We will discuss similarities and differences between these formats and tabletop role-playing games, particularly with regard to their educational potential, their connection to social-emotional learning, and their potency as a result of their somatic, embodied nature. We will emphasize how many larp formats offer players the opportunity to experience a significant amount of agency to make meaningful choices and create play emergently. Tabletop role-playing games can range in scope, intensity, and level of performative enactment. A dungeon crawl featuring only dice rolling, out-of-character strategizing, and combatactions is technically considered a role-playing game, as are games with no dice, no game masters, no combat, and intense immersion into character. In general, the more that players experience embodiment of their character and their performance of the fiction, the closer a game becomes to a larp, although some larps can feature off-game strategizing as well. Embodiment refers to the player physically behaving as they imagine their character would, considering their character in the first-person, i.e. instead of “My character goes to talk to the bartender,” saying “I go talk to the bartender” and/or physically walking up to someone portraying the bartender and speaking to them. Note that for our purposes, embodiment in this case can take place when sitting around a table playing a TTRPG, as some people choose to wear costumes and enact their characters deeply, but the more physical these actions become, the more the game becomes a larp. For example, a group may be playing a game of Fiasco around the table, then choose to physically improvise their characters actions instead of describing them, which is more akin to a larp. Such players may even say, “We got up and larped our game of Fiasco.” As a format, larp is also wide and ranges in scope, intensity, and level of performative enactment. Thus, it becomes difficult to generalize about larp, as different play groups use the term to describe vastly distinct behaviors -- or may not use the term at all when describing behaviors identical to what other groups call “larp.” In general, we define larp as co-creative experiences where participants immerse into fictional characters and realities in an embodied manner for a bounded period of time through emergent playfulness. However, this definition could also be applied to other types of role-playing, such as psychodrama, Drama in Education, improvisation, simulation, and reenactment, as we will discuss in this chapter. Thus, we will refine our definition to focus specifically upon games that have emerged from the RPG subcultures of some kind, whether through the influence of Dungeons \& Dragons (1974) or other subcultural roots. For example, in Russia, larp emerged in the 1990s as groups of players inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien began to run larps based on the books entitled Hobbit Games (Semenov 2010). This refinement of the definition allows us to identify larps that have been designed explicitly for educational goals and note how and why their contributions to pedagogy are unique, i.e. edu-larps (Bowman 2014). For example, if an educational role-playing game was designed inspired by leisure games and includes mechanics of some sort, some sort of fantastic setting, win conditions, and persistent co-creation in a consistent fictional world, we can consider it an edu-larp (Bowman and Standiford 2015). However, a larp inspired by the Nordic larp tradition featuring no mechanics, full embodiment of character, no win conditions, i.e. “playing to lose,” in a socially realistic setting such as a prison can also be an edu-larp (Aarebrot \& Nielsen, 2012) Similarly, a nursing simulation in which health professionals role-play that includes techniques from Nordic or American freeform -- a tabletop/larp hybrid form -- can also be considered an edu-larp (Standiford 2014). However, the pedagogical goals may be the same as in other types of role-playing in educational and therapeutic settings. Thus, in this chapter, we will further explain and define these cousin forms of larp in order to be precise with our terminology. Regardless of definition, embodied role-playing and storytelling are human activities that likely predate the written language. Humans often learn, educate, practice behaviors and bond through embodied play, as evidenced in childhood pretend play (Bowman \& Lieberoth 2018; Kapitany 2022).These different manifestations of embodied role-playing are specific to the socio-cultural contexts within which they emerged, but have many of the same benefits regardless of form. Similarly, many of the benefits of larp can also be achieved through TTRPGs. Thus, this chapter will conclude by discussing the ways in which socio-emotional learning can be enhanced further through physical embodiment as a result of bridging the mental and somatic gap.},

Utilizing psychometric  surveys and semi-structured interviews, the investigators  gathered data from middle school students evaluating their  development along five dimensions of learning before and after  the semester-long program: intrinsic motivation, perceived  competence, school engagement, team work, and leadership. The  study also gathered qualitative data from the 23 students in this  convenient sample group regarding their overall experiences with  the edu-larp method.    When paired with traditional pedagogy, out of these five  dimensions of student development, the investigators found that  the edu-larp intervention helped increase overall intrinsic  motivation and interest/enjoyment of science in the quantitative  data. The qualitative and quantitative findings merged to reveal  improvement in perceived competence in science. In interviews,  students demonstrated a strong belief that larp aided in the  development of all five dimensions and expressed universal  interest in learning through edu-larp in the future. Overall, the  data suggested that adding the edu-larp component to the  existing science curriculum impacted the experience of students  by increasing interest, engagement, and perceived competence in  science through game play and role enactment.},

For the purposes of understanding typical modes of engagement, immersion concepts are considered alongside player motivation theories. Furthermore, this article applies these categories, which are drawn largely from game studies, to the field of health care simulation, categorizing specific practices within the simulation classroom according to types of immersion. The goal of this research is to enhance the understanding and design of simulation by appealing to multiple modes of immersion, which may assist in engaging a greater number of students. Diversifying the types of experiences within health care simulations in order to appeal to multiple modalities of immersion holds the potential to create more rich and layered experiential learning situations..},

  abstract = {This article discusses the limitations of hero’s journey by Joseph Campbell with reference to traditional storytelling, offering examples from role-playing games (RPGs) as alternative modes of engagement with symbolism and archetypes. The hero’s journey represents the development of the individual to maturity as a result of confrontation with their unconscious shadow side. While this trajectory reflects the human experience, it centers an idealized young male hero who becomes singularly important to saving the world from a villainized monstrous other. Other characters in the story are marginalized and decentered, invalidating other important archetypal characters such as the Heroine, the Mother, the Witch, the Trickster, the Sage, and the Divine. This article will discuss the ways in which analog RPG narratives can offer the general benefits of active, mythic, and ironic imagination. Integrating ethnographic interviews with 4 experts in the field, the article outlines critiques of the hero’s journey and discusses the wide variety of archetypes explorable within these alternative story structures, even in traditional role-playing games (RPGs) such as Dungeons \& Dragons. The article will emphasize how players can use these experiences to shape their own narrative identity into more empowering structures of belief and life roadmaps regardless of the type of character they embody.},

These categories are similar to the types established by Gordon Calleja in his work on video game immersion with some minor distinctions. Some forms of immersion focus upon the repetitive execution of a particular task or activity, involving a certain degree of agency or kinesthetic involvement, as Calleja terms it. Some theorists connect the immersionism ideal with the phenomenon of bleed, in which the feelings, thoughts, relationships, and physical states of the player affect the character and vice versa. For many players and theorists alike, the experience of role-playing immersion cannot be divorced from the social contexts—both in-game and out-of-game—within which they transpire. This concept correlates with Calleja’s shared involvement, which includes competition, cooperation, and cohabitation with both human and nonhuman actors within virtual games.},

  abstract = {This article includes an in-depth discussion of the “magical” potential of role-playing. We describe some of the barriers to transformation that can arise from alibi, cognitive dissonance, role-distancing, and the pressures of conformity. We will then examine role-playing from two quite different lenses: a) Conceptualizations of ritual, aspecting, and manifestation in occult and metaphysical traditions; and b Research in the social sciences about the power of thought and narrative upon self-concept, behavior, performance, and well-being. This preliminary exploration of concepts that might help explain the potential of role-playing as a form of postmodern “magic” is by no means exhaustive or detailed. Rather, we present vignettes of thought from various areas of spiritual practice and social science. We explore how role-playing, perspective taking, narrative, ritual, and the conscious use of specific imaginative practices can directly impact people’s performance at tasks, their self-concepts, and their perceived agency. Then, we examine different models of bleed theory, investigating ways that we can raise awareness around bleed effects and consciously steer toward or away from them as needed. If we intentionally emphasize responsibility, safety, and growth in our communities, we can imagine the role-playing space as a transformational container within which we can explore our edges and mold our self-concepts through play. We can use alibi as a tool to permit greater experimentation, while decreasing its strength when we wish to transfer skills, insights, and personality traits outside of the magic circle. Finally, through conscious and deliberate integration practices, we can distill these insights and more permanently infuse our lives with this magic, manifesting new conceptions of self, of community, of relationships, and of our life potential.},

The term avatar, commonly used in video games to refer to virtual representations of the player, will be used similarly to character. For example, tabletop role-playing games may feature miniature figurines that represent characters for use in battles or dungeon crawls. Role-players may also visually render their characters through works of art or photos of celebrities that look like their alter egos in the game.},

Though players often find the RPG experience enjoyable, the process of assuming an alternate identity in a world parallel to the mundane can produce powerful psychological effects. RPGs are used widely in various applications, including theater, therapy, education, military training, and leisure and possess the capability to transform human interactions and enhance valuable skill sets. Engagement in roleplaying creates the potential for self-exploration in the form of identity alteration, problem-solving in the form of scenario building, and establishment of communitas as a modern-day ritual practice.},

Most research on the cognitive effects of games has attempted to understand the links between video game play and aggression. Some see a causal connection, while others refute it.

  abstract = {This volume explores the various social and psychological functions of role-playing, with a specific emphasis on role-playing games. I posit that the activity of role-playing finds its roots in essential aspects of human social behavior, including childhood pretend play, storytelling, and ritual. The subcultural practice of role-playing games emerged from these age-old practices, but also from several cultural shifts inherent to American life in the latter half of the twentieth century. These shifts include culture-wide paradigm shifts regarding diversity, religion, and alternative lifestyles; an increased interest in the fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres; the heightened sense of cynicism and self-awareness characteristic of Generation X; and the large-scale technological advances characteristic of the computer and information age. While these cultural shifts specifically contributed to the popularity of role-playing games as a subculture, people engage in the practice of role-playing in a variety of different contexts, including business, education, military training, improvisational theater, drama therapy, health care, and leisure. The practice of role-playing offers three basic functions. First, role-playing enhances a group‘s sense of communal cohesiveness by providing narrative enactment within a ritual framework. Second, role-playing often encourages complex problem-solving and provides participants with the opportunity to learn an extensive array of skills through the enactment of scenarios. Third, role-playing offers participants a safe space to enact alternate personas through a process known as identity alteration. This volume explores these three concepts with regard to the various forms of role-playing. The study then offers a detailed, participant-observer ethnography involving extensive, qualitative interviews with nineteen respondents. I conclude that the benefits offered by role-playing in more traditional environments are also offered through the leisure activity of role-playing games. Though mainstream American media channels often dismisses involvement in role-playing games as escapist and potentially dangerous, this volume posits the notion that role-playing encourages creativity, self-awareness, empathy, group cohesion, and “out-of-the-box” thinking. The role-playing game platform facilitates the development of various cognitive and social skills that remain useful in the “real world.” Thus, participation in role-playing games should incur a lesser amount of stigma from the larger culture.},

This article provides a theoretical framework for this process, discussing the nature of consensus reality as a force that can suppress forms of identity expression that individuals find authentic. We discuss how live action role-playing (larp) and tabletop games can provide transformational containers, where individuals can explore new ways of being, relating, and enacting beliefs through the experience of increased agency. As an example, we discuss our larp, Euphoria, which was designed as a role-playing game environment reflecting queer performance spaces within which participants can express gender and sexual identities that feel more authentic.},

The market for tabletop games, Seaman and Tran argue, is able to sustain a high level of creativity at a high up-front cost, all while protected by some but not all of the IP rights that other industries’ outputs receive. Is that evidence of IP’s necessity or its superfluousness? In this Response, I argue that the answer is a little bit of both. Whereas prior scholarship has shown the lack of an active role for IP in developing products, Seaman and Tran’s fascinating case studies suggest that IP plays a critical passive role in providing breathing space for innovations. But the example of tabletop games demonstrates that not every aspect of innovative creations—not even the most important aspects—necessarily require IP protection to be successful.},

  abstract = {Tabletop roleplaying is a dynamic and flourishing hobby that has become increasingly accessible to a wide variety of participants. The games themselves, as well as the gaming subculture, offer players a number of personal and social benefits that continue to enrich their lives long after they leave the table. Using Goffman's theories of Dramaturgy and Frame Analysis, this paper seeks to examine the positive impact of gaming in three key areas. The first is an analysis of the subculture which includes the evolution of the games, the growth and diversification of the roleplaying community, and the current shift in stereotypes about gaming. The second section discusses the ways in which microcultural worlds are created, with an emphasis on the systematic alignment of group frames, different types of emotional and social crossover that occurs, and the conveyance of status. The final segment describes the processes that create engrossment and identification in the games. It focuses on the balance of the three frameworks used in fantasy creation, types of physical aids used to bridge fantasy and reality, relationships that exist between players and their characters, and the negotiation of role conflict that arises from maintaining multiple roles simultaneously. The benefits players gain from roleplaying are diverse. It provides socialization and recreational enjoyment, improves role negotiation and impression management, allows players to experience elements that are beyond their reality, creates a safe environment to test new elements of identity, promotes creative problem solving, and builds critical thinking.},

If the three dice all give the same result, another three dice are rolled and added to the total. This is continued until the three dice no longer match. We calculate the average result of the stochastic sum: 10 + 4/5.  We also consider a generalized dice rolling scheme where we roll an arbitrary number of dice with arbitrary number of sides. This generalization is motivated by various exotic dice that are used in many roleplaying games. We calculate the expectation, and how much it differs from the situation where we only roll the set of dice once, with no rerolling and adding. As the number of dice increases, or the number of sides the dice have increases, this difference approaches zero, unless there are two dice (with the number of sides increasing), in which case the difference approaches one.},

  abstract = {Interventions for children and their families have traditionally stemmed from two interrelated frameworks: play-based child therapies, and family therapies (Gil, 2015). Integrated family play therapy frameworks aim to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches by combining meaningful engagement of children through play, and systems-level insights into patterns of family functioning and interaction (Gil, 2015). A virtually unexplored avenue for play-based therapeutic applications of role-play that may lend themselves to an integrated family play therapy framework are tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs); cooperative and narrative-based games wherein players adopt the role of fictional characters as they navigate a fantasy setting arbitrated by a game master. Case studies on the use of TRPGs with children and young adults have yielded initial evidence of their potential therapeutic utility (e.g., Blackmon, 1994; Enfield, 2007; Rosselet \& Stauffer, 2013), however, research on their application is limited, particularly with families. The current study pilot tested an original TRPG module (“The Family Tabletop Adventure”) for use with families to establish the module’s potential therapeutic utility and identify targets for further refinement. A sample of three family groups (N = 11) were recruited to participate in six weekly online sessions (a 1-hour introductory session, four 1.5- to 2-hour game sessions, and a 1-hour exit interview). A variety of mixed-method measures were used to assess family functioning at baseline and post-game, including observational coding, self-report, and qualitative group interviews. Exploratory analyses of the findings indicated the module’s feasibility of implementation and ease of use, low iatrogenic risk, perceptions by families as fun and engaging, and potential utility across a range of family processes relevant to therapeutic contexts, including communication and problem solving, positive interactions and relationship building, and the generation of novel insights about family members. Family feedback was used to identify several targets for additional refinement of the game module to improve families’ comprehension and engagement with the game.

The study examines interactions as they take place across three frames that are associated with interaction in this community of practice: the primary frame, the metagaming frame, and the character frame. The study found that the participants with autism frequently violated the stable pretense awareness context that persists across these frames in tabletop roleplaying game discourse.

  abstract = {In this essay I examine the cover art of the 1979 version of The Dungeon Master's Guide, one of the original pieces of D\&D artwork. Artwork in the D\&D community has shaped and continues to shape how players understand aspects of the game, primarily because the game is one of pure imagination. This particular piece, for example, depicts an efreet, which is described as a giant djinn from the fire plane. Having a visual image allows players to better understand what the creators of D\&D intend the monsters to actually be like. Examining the visual rhetoric of this image reveals the ideology held and perpetuated by the original writers of the game and presumably adopted by original players. The Dungeon Master's Guide is one of the core rule books of D\&D, meaning that the book is required to play the game. The pervasiveness of this image in the D\&D community and its position in D\&D's history makes it an ideal visual text for rhetorical criticism. In the first section of this critique, I review literature about visual rhetoric and gendered images, and I introduce Sonja K. Foss's (1994) schema for evaluating visual imagery. In the second section, I describe the visual elements of the text. In the third section, using Foss's schema, I argue that the cover art of The Dungeon Master's Guide first functions to spark the imagination of its viewers and, second, functions to invite viewers to play D\&D. These functions are only partially supported due to the exaggerated depiction of gender and race in the image, meaning that the image is centered on the hegemonic ideals of heterosexual, white males and is not invitational toward women or racial minorities. Finally, I conclude by articulating the implications of my argument.},

They usually have a middle class background, and are between 16-40 years of age. From time to time, groups of players organise unique plays that they take part in. These plays last from a couple of hours up to a week. They take place in a geographical location that is selected in advance by organisers. The plays are about simulating a make-believe setting, which has its own characters, conflicts and dramatic events, culture, and background history. People who are acting together, or communicating with each other, always do this in the context of a specific definition of a situation. My research question is to look at how the laiv players make and maintain their play situation. A definition of a situation implies a variety of structures that influence the interaction of the participants.  The participants of the situation act in accordance to a set of roles, as well as a normative background that regulates what one should and should not do. These structures also include the background information that one uses when interpreting the meaning of the actions of others. In other words, the study of the process by which a situation is defined is a study of the process by which the social reality becomesstructured. Researchers that study this topic have focused on the relation between general structures – in the form of shared conventions and knowledge, habits and so on – and particular actions that are done in unique contexts of interaction. This study takes an ethnographic approach to this question, with analysis of interviews, observations, and internet texts being the primary method. To play, each of the players is assigned a character in advance. The players emphasise a ‘realistic’ resemblance of physical traits, in order to play the character. Maybe this makes it easier to communicate a character. Nevertheless, players are usually capable of ignoring a lack of resemblance in relation to such traits as height and physical build. Then they increase their ability to structure play in the way they want. External influence from the surrounding culture makes it difficult to ignore lack of resemblance to some traits such as gender and ethnicity.   Some players may lose their involvement in play, or one may risk that players become too involved and fail to separate play from ‘real life’, or actions in play may develop in such a way that play cannot continue. The play situation can then break down for these and other players. The players have a repertoire of techniques to handle this. The play may be stopped, the problematic events sorted out, and then the play can be restarted. Another way is by accepting the performance of one’s co-players, without scrutinising or denying any inconsistencies. This also greatly decreases their need for communicating details. On the one hand, the players and organisers use a variety of preparations and rehearsals in advance of play in order to shape their actions in play. On the other hand, this rarely determines actions completely, leaving considerable room for improvisatory action during play. When improvising, the performance becomes more stereotypic, and this is less ‘realistic’ in some players’ eyes. The players try to have a visual similarity between their material world and the material world in play, and they select and shape their objects and surroundings to achieve such similarity. They are limited by their resources when doing so, but they are capable of ignoring inconsistencies that are impractical to fix. Material objects and surroundings have communicative effects on play in terms of their being shared symbolic signs, and in terms of their physical effects. Players use both of these to communicate the situation of play itself, and to make distinctions in play clearer. To sum up, the process of making and maintaining a definition of a situation involves both using pre-existing structures - in the form of general conventions and particular knowledge of and habits in a situation that are learned and rehearsed in advance - and the use of techniques actively to shape and maintain the situation when acting during play. There is a close relationship between the pre-existing structures and action in context in the process of making and maintaining the play situation. This is particularly clear in five ways throughout the text. First, the players have a great capability of adapting the process of making and maintaining a situation to the demands and possibilities of the particular context of action. Second, the use of conventions that exist in advance of play are intertwined with the interaction in the context of performance. Third, at several places one sees clearly how action is both structured according to pre-existing structure, while simultaneously structuring future action. Fourth, the material environment are a given structure constantly intertwined in the context of performance. Fifth, looking at how the definition of the situation can break down, provides information about the relation between the general conventions of play and the demands of the context of performance.

  abstract = {"Playing With Dragons: Using Role-playing Games to Support Academic Objectives" explores how table role-playing games might positively impact the attainment of classroom learning objectives. This paper begins with an exploration of what a table role-playing game is, and compares it to educational theatre techniques, primarily process drama. While there is a significant amount of research being done in how online computer games can be used to benefit the classroom, there is a dearth of research being done on table role-playing games. I argue that, as a non-digital interactive experience run by a facilitator, table role-playing games share a great deal of commonality with the methodology used to implement process drama. However, table role-playings normally do not concern themselves with the specific positive outcomes regarding student learning. In this case study, I design a table role-playing game for a high school English class studying Sophocles' The Antigone, intended to help a classroom instructor achieve specific, targeted objectives. Before implementing the game in the classroom, I describe the revision and modifications that were made to the game after implementing a trial playtest with adult participants. The revised game was then enacted in the high school classroom, and I provide a detailed report of the significant interactions. Upon completion of the game sessions, all participants are interviewed to share their experience and insights into using the table role-playing game and how it impacted their understanding of the text. I conclude this study with my findings, which demonstrate that table role-playing games can be successfully used in the classroom. The next logical step will be to determine what the best practices are, and in what ways the game design methodology can be improved upon.},

(D\&D) is a table-top role playing game where players take on the personality and actions of a character in the fictional game designed by the Game Master, or GM. Players interact with each other and the GM in a fantasy-based setting. The intimate public of CR was so drastically different from the traditional public that it revitalised and renewed popular culture interest in D\&D as a whole.},

  abstract = {Live action role playing games can be used for educational purposes (edu-LARPs), but information about their learning effectiveness is limited. To our knowledge, even quantitative instruments for in situ measuring (i.e. during playing the game) of affective constructs, for instance flow or generalized positive and negative affect in edu-LARPs, are lacking. Existing instruments cannot be applied straightforwardly due to several reasons; most notably, because they are not gamified. Administering a non-gamified inventory in the game can influence/interrupt the states it is supposed to measure. The research aim of our new project is to investigate acquisition of mental models of mechanical devices learnt within an edu-LARP and correlate the quality of the acquired mental model with in situ flow and generalized positive/negative affect (planned N (similar to) 10 groups x 10 participants). So far, we have conducted three pilots (N = 10, 12, 13) for which we developed a new method for assessing these constructs by in-game questionnaires (and tested the LARP's plot, a sci-fi space opera). The results so far are promising in that we are able to administer the respective questionnaires in situ without adverse effects of the measurement process on these states; as reported by participants in post hoc focus groups. Our method can be probably used in other edu-LARPs provided certain requirements on the LARP's plot are met. Another result is that some components of flow (such as fluency/sense of control) seem to be influenced by role playing but others (such as absorption or time alteration) not so. This indicates that the notion of flow as a unitary construct may not be applicable in LARP contexts.},

Their actions propelled a Satanic conspiracy theory into the cultural mainstream and has had a lasting impact on conservative politics. This project explores how the Satanic Panic came to be, how it advanced and functioned, and how it ended. It also examines question and information often left out of Satanic Panic historiography, such as what Satanism actually is and the roles of class, gender, and race play. This project argues that Satanic conspiracism created a type of political capital that the New Right exploited to other its enemies and advance its causes. As the United States enters a new period of Satanic paranoia in the form of QAnon, understanding the most recent moral panic over Satanism and how it was used for political gain has taken on a new and urgent importance. What can we learn from The Satanic Panic to help address the problems of today?},

  abstract = {In this article we engage with the representation of non-binary gender in two sci-fi/fantasy comics (Runaways and The Order of the Stick), and metatextual discussion surrounding them. In our analysis we focus on how non-binary gender is represented, and ways in which the comics reveal implicit anxieties around non/human characters who are non-binary. The idea that non-binary gender is ‘hiding’ a true, binary, gender is present within and beyond the text: rather than accepting these characters’ non-binary gender as a fact of their species within the narrative, it is treated a puzzle to be solved. We explore how texts, and fans, focus upon the body and subsequently sexuality as a locus of gender ‘truth’, even though as drawings these bodies cannot be further revealed beyond the page or screen. We argue these comics ‘confuse’ gender in different ways: at times by purposefully confounding the possibility of pinpointing a ‘true’ binary gender for non-binary characters, while at others taking a more conservative path of displacing such ‘confusion’ onto the non-binary characters themselves to imply that it is they who are ‘confused’ – while reflecting broader social patterns, this characterizes non-binary gender as though it were not a valid way of being.},

They often invoke heavy themes into their game play: morality, violence, politics, spirituality, or sexuality. Although interesting moral debates perennially appear in the media and academia concerning the appropriateness of games’ ability to deal with such adult concepts, very little is known about the intersection between games, playfulness, and sexuality and what this might mean for players. This book offers an in-depth, ethnographic look into the phenomenon of erotic role-play through the experiences of players in multiplayer and tabletop role-playing games. Brown explores why participants engage in erotic role-play; discusses the rules involved in erotic role-play; and uncovers what playing with sexuality in ludic environments means for players, their partners, and their everyday lives. Taken together, this book provides a rich, nuanced, and detailed account of a provocative topic.},

It provides socialization and recreational enjoyment, improves role negotiation and impression management, allows players to experience elements that are beyond their reality, creates a safe space to test new elements of identity, promotes creative problem solving and builds critical thinking.

  abstract = {In 1974, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson published the world’s first commercial role-playing game, Dungeons \& Dragons. The tabletop roleplaying game provoked a new form of textual engagement: it entangled the fantastic tales of early 20th Century pulp fiction with the practice of play. The tabletop role-playing game initiated new perspectives on how classic texts could not only be read but also played. Our contemporary world is becoming increasingly gamified: digital media applications (from mobile phones to the personal home computer) have embedded game elements, structures, processes, and lexicons in our modern lives. Tabletop role-playing was a herald for, and catalyst, of this contemporary phenomenon. Espen Aarseth notes that tabletop role-playing games can be considered as an early from of the “cybertext,” a text that requires “non-trivial” effort for its engagement, and is “the oral predecessor to computerized, written, adventure games.” The project of this dissertation offers an approach of examining and understanding the practice of tabletop role-playing through Karen Barad’s concept of agential realism. Agential realism is based on concepts of Niels Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation” of quantum phenomenon and its premise that nothing can be observed without changing what is observed. Agential realism requires us to accept and acknowledge our complicity in the creation, physical and sociocultural, of the realities which surround, bound, and interpellate us. This dissertation complicates the notion of singular authorship of isolated texts and realities by examining all the relationships necessary to produce a tabletop roleplaying game text. The first chapter of this dissertation introduces the concepts of agential realism while the second offers the historical context for the emergence of tabletop role-playing games. The third chapter analyzes the affective and aesthetic inspirations for Dungeons \& Dragons to consider the conditions for the emergence of the first commercial tabletop role-playing game and how it would reconfigure the pulp and classic mythologies that inspired it. In the fourth chapter, I examine the rules for Traveller, an early science fiction tabletop role-playing game directly inspired by the practice of Dungeons \& Dragons play, to consider how the procedural mechanics of games impact their authorship. The fifth chapter analyzes another mode of authorship for the role-playing game by analyzing its actual play; in this chapter, I examine specific game sessions from a campaign of the tabletop role-playing game, Call of Cthulhu. Throughout these chapters, we understand how the tabletop role-playing game text, like our physical and sociocultural realities, exist within states of radical possibility. Each mode of authorship, through a text’s inspiration, mechanical construction, and subjective interpretation are observations that fix the tabletop role-playing text into a specific manifestation – thought it may exist within any a priori of an observation. This dissertation advocates for an approach to consider realities, within and beyond the games we play, not as isolated moments of objective experience, but as the inevitable consequences of entanglements with all the authors (and players) that share them.},

D\&D offered an entirely new avenue for readers to interact with fantasy literature; instead of simply reading fantastic novels, players were welcome to inhabit their worlds. This thesis provides both a contextualization of D\&D within our literary history – as a narrative-creating game which relies on performance for its actualization – and an analysis of two of the primary texts responsible for its game world diegesis: Poul Anderson’s Three Hearts and Three Lions and Fritz Leiber’s Fafhrd and Gray Mouser cycle of stories. This analysis offers a generative method for examining artistic influences on the nascent medium of tabletop roleplaying, a new ergodic form of literature. Through an analysis of Anderson’s novel and Leiber’s short stories, we are able to understand how Gygax constructed a new post-modern mythological canon, by interpellating literary elements, perspectives, and narrative decisions, from the popular fictions of early 20th century pulp fiction that he catalogued in D\&D’s Appendix N. This investigation illuminates the importance of literary tradition for creating new legends for our games, in our classic analog field and in our emerging digital landscape, and argues for the necessity of encouraging further curiosity into how our literary traditions shape the imaginations of our present and future game designers, developers, and artists.},

Creating a fctional character as part of the gameplay enabled participants to immerse themselves in their characters and opened up a narrative speculative design space. The gameplay resulted in a deep immersion of the participants and provided insights into potential (robot) technologies supporting daily life activities. All technologies mentioned by participants were collected in a mind map, and from the mind map four fctional robots were created. The fctional robots were also created into a design fction card deck as a tangible prop to utilize in a future game study.},

Si ces craintes restent infondées, on peut toutefois s'interroger sur les raisons de l'attrait exercé sur la jeunesse par ces pratiques. Leur succès s'explique en fait par une variété, une complexité et une modernité insoupçonnée de prime abord. Ces qualités permettent aux individus recouverts sous le terme générique de «jeunes» une large palette de réappropriations symboliques et pratiques de ces objets. La diffusion de ces loisirs ne témoigne donc pas de l'émergence ou de la perpétuation d'une culture «jeune», mais révèle la diversité des statuts et des rapports au réel de chacun. Le refus de la culture légitime par une large part de ce public ne serait-il pas lié à l'impossibilité pour un bon nombre de se réapproprier des œuvres trop marquées socialement? Over the past twenty years, new forms of games for youth have raised numerous ideological and medical concerns. While these fears may be unfounded, we should, however, ask ourselves why young people are so attracted to these activities. Their success can, in fact, be explained by their initially unexpected variety, complexity and modernity. These qualities provide the group of individuals referred to as “youth” with a wide range of symbolic and practical appropriations. The popularity of these leisure activities is therefore not a sign of the emergence or the perpetuation of a “youth” culture, but reveals the games' diversity in adapting to each person's reality. Could the reason that a large part of this group denies legitimate culture not be linked to the fact that for many of them, it is impossible to adopt practices that are too socially stigmatized?},

  abstract = {What can the classic zombie movie, Day of the Dead, tell us about leadership? In our analysis of this film, we explore leadership behaviours in an extreme context – a zombie apocalypse where survivors face persistent existential threat. Extreme context research presents methodological challenges, particularly with regard to fieldwork. The use of films as proxy case studies is one way in which to overcome these problems, and for researchers working in an interpretivist perspective, 'social science fiction' is increasingly used as a source of inspiration and ideas. The contribution of our analysis concerns highlighting the role of leadership configurations in extreme contexts, an approach not previously addressed in this field, but one that has greater explanatory power than current perspectives. In Day of the Dead, we observe several different configurations – patterns of leadership styles and behaviours – emerging, shifting and overlapping across the phases of the narrative, each with radically different consequences for the group of survivors. These observations suggest a speculative theory of leadership configurations and their implications in extreme contexts, for exploring further, with other methods.},

Zasazuje role-playing do rámce simulačních výzkumných metod, rozkrývá jeho epistemo- logii a dosavadní metodologická uchopení zejména v sociální psychologii. Hlavní linií textu je obhajoba epistemologických kvalit metody a experimentu v sociálních vědách obecně. Inspiračním zdrojem je zde na jedné straně Latourova kvalitativní sociologie asociací, tázající se po původu sociality a problematizující samotný před- mět sociálních věd, tj. sociálno. A na druhé straně přístupy naturalizující sociálně- vědné výzkumy propojením s kognitivní vědou. V tomto ohledu je naším klíčovým předpokladem pro smysluplné uchopení sociální reality v její simulované podobě shodnost kognitivních mechanismů skutečného i simulovaného jednání. V pojetí textu jsou oba zdroje spojeny jejich akcentem na tematizaci sociálna jako inter-psychologického fenoménu mezi tradiční mikro a makro úrovní.

It frames role-playing to the simulating research methods, opens its epistemological pro- perites and methodological conceptions in social psyschology. Main argument constructs the defense of epistemological properties of active role-playing as an experimental method in the social sciences in general. The inspiring source is one the side Latour's sociology of associations, which problematizes the very subject of social sciences, the sociality itself and on the other side the naturalizing approaches connecting social sciences and cognitive science. In this context main argument for meaningfulness of simulated social reality lies in the usage of the same cognitive mechanisms in the real and simulated so- cial interaction. In the article perspective both sources are united by their accent on perceiving social reality as fundamentaly interpsychological phenomenon between the traditional conpcetions micro and macro level. Through analogy of Petri dish article conpcetualizes shift of the original method of situational social psychology toward utililization of designed diegetic liminal situations as laboratories of the social.Keywords: active role-playing; research methods in social sciences; experimental in social sciences; social cognition},

We detail the application and outcomes of a novel heuristic evaluation framework tailored for tabletop serious games, dubbed "Play with Purpose." This framework is distinguished by its focus on eight essential categories: Learning Experience, Utility, Game Features, Social Dynamics, Adaptability, Learning and Feedback, Play Experience, and Accessibility, marking a significant contribution to the evaluation of non-digital game-based learning tools. Furthermore, we delve into the insights gained from participatory design sessions with students, aimed at evaluating CiteSaga's component appeal and game mechanics. The paper culminates in a discussion on how student feedback has informed subsequent iterations of CiteSaga, underscoring the critical role of heuristic evaluations in refining game-based learning experiences. Our findings not only advance understanding of empirical evaluation methodologies for tabletop serious games but also provide a valuable framework for future research and development in educational game design.},

Typically, however, these games are specifically designed to focus upon an exact facet of learning. Examples include the replication or simulation of certain scenarios, establishing focus upon an affective objective, or presenting content in an alternative manner. Rather than utilize a game for a purpose described above, this article explores two unique possibilities. First, that by using an established role-playing game (RPG) as a learning activity, it is possible to reinforce key social learning constructs desired in educational settings that can regularly only be taught in non-optimal settings. Second, the game itself can serve as a platform for the new type of learning desired in the future of education. In the discussion, the author theorizes if these two possibilities are evident, the future of education may be at a crossroads where it is necessary to reconsider our educational objectives.},

However, such augmentation will also bring changes in game design and these changes were not investigated thorougly in previous studies. To understand how game design of such games may change due to the usage of wearables and movement-based play, we conducted a participatory design workshop with (1) 25 participants, (2) designed a new game system according to our findings and (3) evaluated it with iterative tests with 15 participants in TTRPG sessions. Our study resulted in 8 player-centered game design implications for the use of arm-worn devices and movment-based play in narrative based long-term games like TTRPG. The implications present clues about forming the narrative, regulating the rules and the functional use of the device in game mechanics.},

These works separate the individual benefits from the social benefits, overlooking symbolic interactionist insights into social life. As Fine (1983) describes in his seminal work on the “shared fantasy” of table-top role-playing gamers, social play is tantamount to gamers’ leisure activities. To build on more recent leisure research that establishes the importance of social gaming, we explore the social dynamics of video and table-top gamers’ leisure and its impact on their relationships. Using interview and ethnographic data from two independent studies, we examine three emergent gaming processes: gamers’ focus on social play, developing social skills, and passing games up/down to relatives and friends. Overall, this work draws attention to how gamers engage in social play, a direct contrast to gamer stereotypes still held by many non-gamers.},

Yet there has been little attention devoted to the meaningful ways RPGs have shaped society at large over the last four decades. RPGs were influential on video game design and have been widely represented in film, television and other media. They have made their mark on other areas of society, as well, including education, social media, corporate training and the military. This collection of new essays illustrates the broad appeal and impact of RPGs. Topics range from a critical reexamination of the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, to the growing significance of RPGs in education, to the potential for "serious" RPGs to provoke awareness and social change. The contributors discuss the myriad subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways in which the values, concepts and mechanics of RPGs have infiltrated popular culture.},

  abstract = {Over the last couple of years, cyber security attacks have become a dominant issue in the global landscape. Phishing campaigns are on the rise and the world is in a current "gold rush for ransomware". Companies are being targeted with an increased frequency all around the world. This calls for IT experts, which often receive their first in-depth training in security during their time at college or in secondary education. The goal of this thesis is to better prepare students with the development of an incident response role-playing game. This can be achieved by collaborative training and using simulations to mimic a situation as close as possible to the real-world scenario. Teaching with versatile and adaptable scenarios builds up skills to prepare a company against different kinds of attacks and how to mitigate them, should one of its systems be compromised. Additionally, they learn to appropriately react, how to communicate, and on which basis to make meaningful decisions, as a key to success for eradication of the attacker and recovery to normal operation.  The result of the bachelor thesis is a framework, that gives guidance for the creation of packages and scenarios in a versatile and adaptable way, packages, that can be chained to create scenarios, and predefined scenarios to directly start a cybersecurity role-playing game. The framework allows for interchangeable content, which makes it possible to change certain parts of the role-play giving it an agile nature. The packages also include additional materials, such as text scripts, presentations, and curated internet content to deepen the knowledge about cyber security attack techniques and mitigations. The predefined scenarios are created with the packages and were tested during the thesis.  It started with an analysis of existing products, we evaluated if any of them could be an exact fit for our purposes. Sadly, none of them fully met the requirements. So we then used them to draw inspiration for our product. After we defined how the game is going to be played and how the framework for content creation is structured, we started the process of content creation itself. For verification and improvements of the content, we established a process of peer-reviews, asked external educators for their opinions, and tested it with our target audience. The created content was finally verified with an acceptance test, the results of which allowed for final improvements to be made to the product.  The landscape of cybersecurity threats is ever-changing, and incident responders need to be trained with an adequately agile approach. Our product offers a solid framework that allows us to create, edit and change our scenarios to keep the simulation dynamic and tailor it to the user's needs. This allows us to provide an interactive learning experience that helps inexperienced students take their first steps in a simulated environment, or advanced students hone their skills.

  abstract = {ESPAÑOL Los juegos de rol se pensaron ya como una herramienta educativa. Generalmente, se adaptaron sus idiosincrasias al contexto didáctico-pedagógico, como simulación de situaciones relevantes para el tema a enseñar. Pocas veces fue aprovechado su potencial para servir de puente entre la historiografía (escritura de la historia), la narratología (estudio de las narraciones), la metahistoria (estudio de cómo se escribe e interpreta la historiografía en tanto narración). En esta ponencia proponemos estudiar cómo las herramientas de un juego de rol particular colaboran con el estudio metahistórico de la conquista del imperio azteca, teniendo en cuenta la polisemia de la expresión: el sometimiento que la triple alianza realizó sobre otros pobladores aborígenes, y el que sufrió a manos de los conquistadores españoles. A su vez, pusimos esa propuesta en práctica y compartimos los resultados del experimento. En particular, diseñamos el juego de rol Leyenda (en prensa) con procedimientos precisos para construir cuatro tipos de módulos. Estos son: Ambición (para crear un módulo en el que una comunidad está sufriendo cambios indeseados), Intriga (para crear uno en el que una comunidad está sufriendo por las luchas internas de sus facciones), Misión (para crear uno en el que una comunidad está sufriendo daños y alguien debe buscar cómo repararlos), y Rebelión (para crear uno en el que la comunidad está sufriendo por la lucha entre el orden establecido y los disidentes). Al ser jugados, despliegan una narración única al grupo, que, ya terminada, encaja con uno de los cuatro tipos de relatos identificados por Northrop Frye (Anatomy of Criticism, 1957): Comedia, Épica, Ironía y Tragedia. Proponemos que, para adaptar una situación histórica a un módulo de juego, es necesario hacer una investigación, seleccionar y explicitar las fuentes investigadas (sean literarias, fílmicas, históricas, etc.), a partir de las cuales se destilarán los elementos necesarios para escribir el módulo. Al seguir los procedimientos del juego, especialmente diseñados teniendo en cuenta modelos narratológicos, el grupo desplegará su creatividad, construyendo su propia leyenda sobre esos elementos básicos que fueron destilados de las fuentes. A partir del análisis narratológico de esa leyenda resultante, es posible compararlo con las posturas sobre cómo investigar una situación histórica, cómo seleccionar las fuentes más apropiadas, y cómo, cuando se expone una interpretación, su narración suele ajustarse a alguno de los cuatro tipos de relatos de Frye, algo ya señalado por Hayden White (Metahistory, 1973). Para poner a prueba esa hipótesis, llevamos a cabo un experimento: investigamos la situación histórica de la conquista del imperio azteca, seleccionando y explicitando nuestras fuentes (primarias, secundarias, ficcionales y lúdicas); luego, creamos un módulo por cada uno de los cuatro procedimientos en función de la investigación; después, los dimos a directores de juego para que los jueguen, junto con cuestionarios para recopilar información sobre sus partidas; y finalmente, hicimos un análisis del resultado desde el cruce de esas áreas con nuestra propuesta lúdica, que servirán para fomentar relecturas de esa situación histórica crítica. ENGLISH Role-playing games were already thought of as an educational tool. Generally, their idiosyncrasies were adapted to the didactic-pedagogical context, as a simulation of situations relevant to the subject to be taught. Their potential to serve as a bridge between historiography (the writing of history), narratology (the study of narratives), and metahistory (the study of how historiography is written and interpreted as a narrative) was rarely exploited. In this paper we propose to study how the tools of a particular role-playing game collaborate with the metahistorical study of the conquest of the Aztec empire, taking into account the polysemy of the expression: the subjugation that the triple alliance carried out on other aboriginal settlers, and the one suffered at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors. In turn, we put this proposal into practice and shared the results of the experiment. In particular, we designed the Leyenda role-playing game (in press) with precise procedures for constructing four types of modules. These are: Ambition (to create a module in which a community is undergoing unwanted changes), Intrigue (to create one in which a community is suffering from factional infighting), Mission (to create one in which a community is suffering damage and someone must seek to repair it), and Rebellion (to create one in which the community is suffering from the struggle between the established order and dissidents). When played, they unfold a unique narrative to the group, which, when completed, fits one of the four types of stories identified by Northrop Frye (Anatomy of Criticism, 1957): Comedy, Epic, Irony, and Tragedy. We propose that, in order to adapt a historical situation to a game module, it is necessary to do research, select and make explicit the sources investigated (be they literary, filmic, historical, etc.), from which the elements necessary to write the module will be distilled. By following the procedures of the game, specially designed taking into account narratological models, the group will deploy its creativity, building its own legend on those basic elements that were distilled from the sources. From the narratological analysis of that resulting legend, it is possible to compare it with the positions on how to investigate a historical situation, how to select the most appropriate sources, and how, when an interpretation is exposed, its narration usually conforms to one of Frye's four types of narratives, something already pointed out by Hayden White (Metahistory, 1973). To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment: we investigated the historical situation of the conquest of the Aztec empire, selecting and making explicit our sources (primary, secondary, fictional and ludic); then, we created a module for each of the four procedures according to the investigation; then, we gave them to game directors to play, together with questionnaires to collect information about their games; and finally, we made an analysis of the result from the crossing of those areas with our ludic proposal, which will serve to encourage rereadings of that critical historical situation.},

  abstract = {The role of chance in games has evolved rapidly since the mid-twentieth century. Games rely not only on artefacts, designed to calibrate uncertainty, but also on psychological dispositions that allow us to engage with the action of the game despite its futility. This means that the choices that are made during play are guided not only by more or less random mechanisms (from chess to roulette) but also by how lucky we feel. Instead of pitting the agôn against the alea, most contemporary game designers mobilise chance in innovative ways: by randomising roles, environments or even rules; by uncoupling the notions of chance and luck or by using lot-drawing to build stories. Games and gambling create situations that reconcile tactical decision-making with moments of loss of control that occur when chance intervenes, as in horse-racing, for instance.},

Elle présente un grand intérêt pour les sciences du jeu, notamment par la mise en avant d’activités autotéliques et par la prise en compte du défi, de l’apprentissage et du plaisir. Néanmoins, cette seule clé n’ouvre pas toutes les portes. Un modèle comme celui de G. Calleja semble plus adapté à l’étude des jeux contemporains. Les six dimensions qu’il explore font apparaître le jeu comme intrinsèquement complexe et non optimal. Sa distinction entre macro- et micro-engagement révèle des formes négligées de la relation au jeu qui se manifestent en dehors des parties. Le modèle MÉDIAL (Moteur, Épreuve, Diégèse, Intrigue, Autrui et Ludologie) reprend l’approche multidimensionnelle de Calleja en y ajoutant deux ambitions. Premièrement, le sous- et le sur-engagement y apparaissent comme des formes socialement problématiques de l’expérience ludique. Deuxièmement, la réflexivité n’est plus traitée comme une distanciation mais considérée comme une dimension à part entière de l’engagement. MÉDIAL permet de cartographier les jeux et les joueurs dans un espace complexe, sans préjuger de la légitimité des formes de l’engagement.},

  abstract = {Nés dans les années 1970 avec Donjons et dragons, les jeux de rôle sur table proposent de vivre des aventures de fiction en y interprétant toutes sortes de personnages. Au contraire des jeux vidéo, où le monde est entièrement programmé par les développeurs, ces jeux favorisent une création à différents niveaux et par différents participants, de la proposition globale de l’auteur aux aménagements locaux des joueurs au fil de l’improvisation. « Vous êtes dans une auberge. Tout à coup, une femme aux cheveux roussis fait irruption parmi les buveurs en criant : “À l’aide ! Le temple est en flammes !” Que faites-vous ? » Une situation tendue et un « Que faites-vous ? » peuvent suffire à lancer un jeu de rôle sur table. Un des participants – nous venons de le faire parler – décrit les situations, interprète les personnages secondaires et arbitre les actions : c’est le meneur de jeu. Les autres créent et interprètent les héros d’une intrigue qui va se nouer et se dénouer au fil du dialogue et des jets de dés : ce sont les joueurs. Certains de ces « rôlistes » peuvent improviser durant des heures en imaginant simplement le décor et les protagonistes autour de leur personnage au fil de l’action. Mais ils choisissent pour la plupart de jouer leur personnage dans un monde qui préexiste à leurs parties et dans lequel d’autres aventures pourront se dérouler. Ces mondes présentent la particularité d’être construits sur au moins trois niveaux. On y accède d’abord par les ressources encyclopédiques fournies dans le manuel du jeu, qui constitue une sorte de « bible » créative pour ses utilisateurs…},

  abstract = {Cet ouvrage est un recueil d'articles francophones sur le jeu de rôle et sa pratique, englobant des conseils de création ou de maîtrise. Il appartient à la collection "L'Atelier du Jeu de Rôle", qui se décline sur divers thèmes. Pour ce premier ouvrage de la collection, le thème exploré est l'Histoire. L'ouvrage, qui débute par une introduction d'Olivier Caïra ("Les Affleurements de l'Histoire", 4 pages) est divisé en trois parties contenant chacune trois articles. Trois jeux, trois traitements de l'Histoire     "Te Deum pour un massacre - Jouer dans une Histoire douloureuse" (14 pages) de Jean-Philippe Jaworski présente la genèse et les options ayant présidé à la création de ce jeu de rôle historique.     "Pavillon Noir - La piraterie entre Histoire et mythe" (16 pages) de Renaud Maroy fait de même pour Pavillon Noir.     "Maléfices - Odeur de soufre sur l'École des chartes" (14 pages) de Daniel Dugourd est consacré au jeu Maléfices. Jouer dans un cadre historique     "Comment écrire une campagne historique" (24 pages) de Jérôme Larré propose de nombreux conseils sur la manière de créer une campagne historique (dans notre réalité ou dans un jeu à l'histoire touffue), l'article est illustré par une des campagnes maison de l'auteur se passant au Japon.     "Traiter l'Histoire au travers du genre" (16 pages) de Romain d'Huissier est une réflexion sur l'utilisation du genre (polar, capes et d'épées, etc.) afin de typer un jeu historique et permettre, grâce à cette lentille, une meilleure immersion des joueurs.     "Les Rôlistes et le Moyen-Age : le familier et l'exotique" (20 pages) de Antoine Dauphragne présente les résultats d'une recherche universitaire sur les représentations du Moyen-Age dans la population roliste. Cette enquête est basée sur des entretiens de type qualitatifs menés auprès de rôlistes parisiens. Les plaies vives de l'Histoire     "Traiter les problématiques et les thèmes difficiles" (22 pages) de Christophe Chaudier et Yann Lefebvre discute, pour le jeu Crimes, de la manière de traiter des sujets délicats et adultes. Il propose des pistes de réflexion afin de mener et de créer des scénarios pour ce jeu.     "Nazisme et jeu de rôle" (12 pages) d'Olivier Caïra analyse la manière dont les jeux de rôle ont traité et présenté le thème délicat du Nazisme.     "Tentacules et croix gammées" (12 pages) de Christophe Valla présent la manière dont l'auteur de l'article, au travers du Pulp, a créé une campagne se déroulant durant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. De nombreux encarts parsèment l'ouvrage et proposent des réflexions complémentaires ou des zooms sur des jeux particuliers. Cette fiche du GROG a été rédigée le 10 mai 2009.

Elle repose sur la levée des contraintes de preuve : par recoupement pour les fictions mimétiques (roman, film. . . ), par isomorphisme pour les univers axiomatiques (jeu d'échecs, Tetris. . . ). Entre ces deux pôles apparaît une famille méconnue : les jeux de simulation, qui lient la visée mimétique (le monde à simuler) à un dispositif logicomathématique (le simulateur).},

  abstract = {Storygames are communication devices specifically designed to spark collective improvisation in natural language, using different parts of a fictional diegesis : characters, objects, actions, places, relationships, issues... Often overshadowed by video games or confused with tabletop role-playing games, these recently developed games remain overlooked by most scholars, although they provide ideal observation conditions and new research avenues for narratologists and interactivity theorists. Since the publication of Once Upon a Time (1994), dozens of games have enriched the diversity of available narrative traditions in this field: fairy tales, horror B-movies (Polar Base), historical drama (Montségur 1244) or the Coen brothers’ universe (Fiasco). As a product, a storygame does not display any narrative, but provides rules and tools (dice, cards, blank forms) that can generate a continuously renewed narrative production. This is why the issue of how knowledge is mobilized during storygame sessions is crucial to the ethnographic study of the links between narration and interactivity. Collective encyclopedias – in Umberto Eco’s sense – allow the sharing and the development of a plot, on the basis of sparse diegetic information, in “rotating narrator” devices where interpretative cooperation failures often lead to in-game conflict.},

  abstract = {Fieldwork in the production and reception of interactive fictions reveals a paradox: everybody uses the narratologist’s toolbox, but nobody wants to tell or be told stories. The interactive experience is rather described as a quest, an investigation, a negotiation, etc.  What these forms of experience share with storytelling lies upstream in the creative process. Moving one step backwards, scholars can study plot before narrative. By doing so, they can further the diversification of  narratology and at the same time consolidate contemplative and interactive fictions. Novels and videogames can be built on similar plot structures, but with specific features: exposition / complication / resolution in a novel; instructions / challenge / evaluation in a game.  Moreover, plot does not imply a top-down conception of communication. Narrator / narratee models can be replaced by intrigant / intriguee or riddler / riddlee patterns, but it is also interesting to see plot as a shared, author-free, object. Thus, interactivity is not merely a choice between existing storylines, but a co-construction of fictional events on a stage (improvisational theater), around a table (tabletop RPGs), in a real setting (live action RPGs) or online (MUDs, MMORPGs). These plot-based events are tellable, but seldom told.},

Si les jeux abstraits constituent un pôle autonome d’expression logico-mathématique, les jeux de simulation sont en revanche créés par association d’un thème et d’un système, ce qui les rend à la fois mimétiques et axiomatiques. On étudie ici différentes manifestations de plaisir esthétique liées à l’expérience des jeux, indépendamment de leur ornementation visuelle ou sonore. Pour les jeux abstraits, on identifie trois motifs~: le sublime qui reflète notre incapacité à embrasser l’immensité d’une combinatoire, le subtil qui se révèle lors de la résolution d’énigmes originales ou difficiles, et le merveilleux qui découle de la découverte de propriétés inattendues du système. Les jeux de simulation sont étudiés en deux temps~: les jeux de plateau et de rôle dont le système fonctionne comme une épure, et les jeux vidéo qui associent performance générale du moteur et création d’écarts esthétiques par le détail.},

In this paper, we frame D\&D specifically as a dialogue system challenge, where the tasks are to both generate the next conversational turn in the game and predict the state of the game given the dialogue history. We create a gameplay dataset consisting of nearly 900 games, with a total of 7,000 players, 800,000 dialogue turns, 500,000 dice rolls, and 58 million words. We automatically annotate the data with partial state information about the game play. We train a large language model (LM) to generate the next game turn, conditioning it on different information. The LM can respond as a particular character or as the player who runs the game--i.e., the Dungeon Master (DM). It is trained to produce dialogue that is either in-character (roleplaying in the fictional world) or out-of-character (discussing rules or strategy). We perform a human evaluation to determine what factors make the generated output plausible and interesting. We further perform an automatic evaluation to determine how well the model can predict the game state given the history and examine how well tracking the game state improves its ability to produce plausible conversational output.},

These cases provided context and scaffolding for creative assignments in which students used ancient material to design their own games. Fostering student engagement with ancient material through the analysis, play, and design of modern games gives another pedagogical avenue for approaching ideas about how cultures influence texts and how ideas about the past are received in contemporary media.},

To explore the range of literacy experience opportunities, present in its play, we present our experiences designing and playing a Fiasco session and reflect upon the transformative potential of tabletop games in creating literacy experiences. The position we undertake, in favor of the considered use of TRPGs for learning through serious gaming in classrooms, is reflective of the experiences within our local gaming and learning communities. Based upon this experience and relevant literature, we contend that table-top gaming fits well within literacy pedagogy and explore how they can be used in classrooms. Therefore, our discussion is centered upon the potential of tabletop games experiences to be considered inventive, specifically in relation to the teaching and learning of literacy skills within a serious gaming framework.},

  abstract = {Esta investigação se propôs identificar qual o sentido da revivência dos mitos na contemporaneidade, na esfera dos jogos de Roleplaying Games (RPG, uma das mais recentes manifestações do fenômeno na atualidade), através da apreensão da dimensão simbólica contida no universo desses jogos, e verificar a possibilidade da ocorrência de uma experiência do sagrado em seu contexto. O estudo foi realizado no Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências das Religiões (CsRs) na Universidade Federal da Paraíba, inserindo-se na linha de pesquisa Religião, Cultura e Produção Simbólica, bem como no Grupo de Estudos e Pesquisas em Antropologia do Imaginário. Foram escolhidos métodos e técnicas de pesquisa que possibilitassem a verificação da hipótese levantada. A tipologia selecionada para a análise foi a pesquisa descritiva histórico-estrutural, com abordagem qualitativa do tipo sócio-antropo-fenomenológica. Como técnicas para a coleta de dados na pesquisa de campo foram utilizados a observação participante, a escuta pedagógica, as anotações em diário de campo acompanhadas da compilação teórica, as entrevistas, os questionários abertos com perguntas estruturadas e a aplicação do Teste Arquetípico dos Nove Elementos AT-9. Enquanto pesquisa interdisciplinar foi necessário buscar subsídios: na Sociologia Compreensiva de Maffesoli; nas teorias antropológicas relacionadas ao processo míticoritual e às experiências do sagrado no passado e na atualidade de Turner, Lévy-Strauss e Eliade; nas proposições sobre os jogos, categoria que circunscreve o objeto de estudo, em Juizinga, Retondar e no livro do Jogador Dungeons \& Dragons (norteador das aventuras de RPG); e no campo do imaginário, G. Durand, Y. Durand, Pitta e Lahud Loureiro. O confrontamento dos estudos teóricos com os pressupostos da Teoria Geral do Imaginário (TGI), os dados colhidos na pesquisa de campo e os resultados obtidos através da aplicação do AT-9, possibilitou a realização de uma análise mais criteriosa e segura do fenômeno, conferindo o sentido atribuído ao jogo e ao jogar pelos indivíduosjogadores. O uso da TGI, ao favorecer o desvendamento dos micro-universos simbólicos dos indivíduos-jogadores, permitiu que se confirmasse a hipótese de que o jogo e o jogar (nesse caso específico o jogo de RPG), se mostraram profundamente reveladores da subjetividade humana. Na roda de jogo de RPG observada, os indivíduos-jogadores se organizaram de maneira tribal e apresentaram comportamentos inclinados para a socialidade. A evasão lúdica que pode ocorrer como um artifício ocasionador da fuga da realidade objetiva pode representar, no campo do imaginário, uma fuga do tempo devorador que conduz à finitude. Já o arcaísmo é um dos fatores que favorecem uma abertura para a transcendência em busca de elementos reveladores dos significados e significâncias da vida e do viver. Esses fatores, dentre outros, induzem o deslocamento do campo religioso para áreas antes consideradas profanas, e no caso do jogo, um retorno cíclico das simbologias relacionadas ao sagrado, favorecendo experiências do sagrado, mesmo que de forma virtual. Levando-se em conta a inexistência de outras análises do fenômeno jogo no âmbito das CsRs, essa pesquisa vem preencher uma lacuna, promovendo uma ampliação do seu campo de pesquisas, ao mesmo tempo em que esse fator lhe confere originalidade.},

  abstract = {Le jeu de rôle sur table, créé dans les années 1970, est primitivement une activité de loisir. Cependant, nous avons pu relever de nombreuses similitudes avec une psychothérapie, sans même qu’il ne soit nécessaire de modifier cette activité. Ce travail entreprend donc d’explorer au-delà de ces premières constatations, et vise à tester cette théorie d’abord par la lecture et la comparaison de la bibliographie, puis de manière exploratoire sous forme d’une activité thérapeutique. Dans sa première partie, cette thèse présente ce qu’est le jeu de rôle sur table (ou papier) moderne. Elle présente notamment les bases de son rapprochement avec les psychothérapies. Dans sa deuxième partie, elle explorera l’essence-même des psychothérapies, à commencer par ce qui fait l’efficacité et la nature d’une psychothérapie. Ensuite, elle cherchera toutes les formes psychothérapeutiques qui sont à rapprocher du jeu de rôle, au premier rang desquelles la narrative therapy. Enfin, cette partie fera le lien entre jeu de rôle sur table et psychothérapie, de manière théorique et pratique (en mettant en avant les utilisations qui existent déjà du jeu de rôle, et même du jeu de rôle sur table). La troisième partie présentera notre approche exploratoire. Elle présentera d’abord la méthode générale de notre approche, avant de s’attarder sur les sept patients qui ont participé à une activité thérapeutique sous forme de jeu de rôle. Ce travail sur la place psychothérapeutique potentielle du jeu de rôle sur table pose (ou repose) les jalons d’une voie peu explorée, à ce jour éparpillée dans une littérature peu connue, mais dont les premiers résultats sont très encourageants; mais questionne également sur la nature de ce qu’est la psychothérapie, à une époque où le nombre d’écoles et de techniques est à son paroxysme.},

  abstract = {The cultural identity of peoples is being lost day by day due to the modernity of the present, since it is common for human beings to adopt customs, traditions, lifestyles, among other elements that are alien to their roots. Unfortunately, we forget our cultural identity, that which belongs to us by the simple fact of having been born in our place of origin, which characterizes us and makes us different from the other cultures that exist in the world. Preschool education is an opportunity to foster the cultural identity of the community through playful activities that promote the promotion, knowledge, valuation and appreciation of traditions, customs, Mayan language, among other elements that characterize and identify Yucatecan students. The objective of this article is to identify the strategies used by preschool teachers to transmit the Yucatecan cultural identity through the tradition of Hanal Pixán to their students; likewise, to design a playful proposal using role-playing as a strategy to approach the aforementioned theme and tradition. The study was conducted under the qualitative approach, using the action-research design and was developed in a Kindergarten, located in the city of Merida, Yucatan; to collect the information, a survey and an observation script were used as data collection instruments. The survey allowed us to identify the pre-school teachers' conception of Yucatecan cultural identity and the strategies they use to transmit Yucatecan cultural identity to their students. As results, it was obtained that teachers generally use strategies where students observe the characteristic elements of cultural identity such as traditional clothing, traditional utensils and ancestral practices, using technological resources such as videos and images. Similarly, a role-playing game entitled "Chiich ¿Dónde está el pib?" was designed for preschool students in the kindergartens of Merida, Yucatan, with the purpose of transmitting the Yucatecan cultural identity through the Hanal Pixan festivity.},

  abstract = {“Queer Play: Facilitating Explorations of Gender and Sexuality in Role Playing Games” was a UREAP research project that I undertook between April and September 2016 in which I investigated the potential for digital and analog roleplaying games to be used as tools to encourage players to embody characters with alternative identities. As part of this process, I developed my own tabletop role playing game, Vestige, to test these strategies with groups of players. The strategies I developed were synthesized from and inspired by existing role playing games, particularly those that are well known among queer gamers, though many lesser known games were reviewed as well. The investigation culminated with the implementation of an Affinities and Aversions system in Vestige, which encourages the player to play with shifting relationships and identities. As a result, even the most trope-based characters will undergo some sort of identity fluctuation through the process of extended play. The players, in turn, are given game space and even encouraged to explore gender and sexuality vicariously through the characters they create.},

  abstract = {Dread Trident examines the rise of imaginary worlds in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs), such as Dungeons and Dragons. With the combination of analog and digital mechanisms, from traditional books to the internet, new ways of engaging the fantastic have become increasingly realized in recent years, and this book seeks an understanding of this phenomenon within the discourses of trans- and posthumanism, as well as within a gameist mode. The book explores a number of case studies of foundational TRPGs. Dungeons and Dragons provides an illustration of pulp-driven fantasy, particularly in the way it harmonizes its many campaign settings into a functional multiverse. It also acts as a supreme example of depth within its archive of official and unofficial published material, stretching back four decades. Warhammer 40k and the Worlds of Darkness present an interesting dialogue between Gothic and science-fantasy elements. The Mythos of HP Lovecraft also features prominently in the book as an example of a realized world that spans the literary and gameist modes. Realized fantasy worlds are becoming ever more popular as a way of experiencing a touch of the magical within modern life. Reworking Northrop Frye's definition of irony, Dread Trident theorizes an ironic understanding of this process and in particular of its embodied forms.},

Some scholars conclude that these elements are fundamentally at odds with one another in game and narrative design. In this paper, we discuss how their relationship is symbiotic—not antagonistic—by articulating a novel nexus between story and gameplay. We term this nexus a narrative goal, defined as a player interpretation of a ludological goal, which in turn is a condition a player is expected to meet to succeed at the game. We articulate this nexus as part of a novel framework centered on Goals, Feedback, and Interpretation (GFI), which is useful for characterizing uniquely narrative phenomena that arises as part of a designer’s effort to align story and gameplay. GFI complements the long-standing Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) framework, and we evidence its utility by analyzing problems when trying to align story and gameplay, as well as offering perspectives on how to design them to achieve particular narrative effects. We believe that narrative goals and GFI have potential to clarify the narrative design process, and offer them as conceptual tools for researchers and practitioners to decompose, study, and design a broad class of games that are intended to elicit a sense of story.},

  abstract = {CAR-PGa is the Committee for the Advancement of Role-Playing Games, an international network of researchers into all aspects of role-playing games (RPGs). In the 1980s, there was a major campaign attacking RPGs. Because of the inaction of the game publishers' organization at that time, CAR-PGa was formed to find out what the problem was. CAR-PGa members' research showed that the charges—the same ones that are repeated to this day—had absolutely no foundation in fact. Today, CAR-PGa's primary focus has shifted from game defense to a study of all aspects of RPGs: Material is collected by members and sent to the Chair, who catalogs it and publishes a notice of the new acquisitions in the Newsletter along with other game information. When an attack on RPGs resurfaces, CAR-PGa makes sure that its members know about it and they check the relevant research and records of historical attacks, investigate the specific circumstances of the renewed attack, and respond with the hard facts. Membership is dues-free, but work is expected from our members. This can include a number of things: writing a letter to the editor of the local newspaper or writing a peer-reviewed paper for a scholarly publication; keeping a watch on the mass media for any story that may affect gamers; collecting material from anti-gamer organizations; an appearance on local TV or radio; finding us a grant; recruiting more active members; etc. Beyond that, we only ask that members keep us informed of these things, sending us copies of material produced or found so we can make it available to the rest of the group, and keep us informed of any changes in the membership-form data.},

  abstract = {The contemporary youth cohort is confronted with many transformative dynamics and adversities, which have garnered significant attention in the media landscape. Cultivating dynamic literacies (Potter \& McDougall, 2017) emerges as imperative for navigating through the deluge of information and discerning falsehoods, particularly when news is accessed through unfiltered social media channels (Herdzina \& Lauricella, 2020, Krumsvik, 2023, Santos et al., 2023). Against this backdrop, the YOMEDIA project - Youngsters’ Media Literacy in Times of Crisis - has been funded by the European Media and Information Fund established by the European University Institute and the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. The primary objective of this endeavor was to address these concerns through the conceptualization and implementation of a hybrid game focusing on misinformation/disinformation, and information literacy in times of crisis. Video games have acquired a fresh perspective following the experiences endured during the pandemic, notably concerning personal well-being and social connection (Cauberghe et alii, 2021, Kriz, 2020, Ohannes et alii, 2021). This pivotal shift prompted YO-MEDIA to advocate for enhancing young people's media literacy through ludic tools and languages. Games and video games foster a more critical and participatory engagement among youth, facilitated by narrative immersion, identification mechanisms with characters or stories, interactive elements coupled with the allowance for failure, and the necessity to formulate strategies applicable beyond the gaming realm (Moro et al., 2022). The contribution presents the tangible outcomes of YO-MEDIA (Carenzio, Ferrari, Pasta, 2024), specifically the video game, and the board games, which are the result of the writing and production efforts of the project team, in particular, the mechanics, graphic choices, characters, and atmospheres of the hybrid game. “Social Media Puppeteers” is a micro TTRPG adapted and customized to create an educational experience focused on media literacy, critical thinking, and social media dynamics developed by the Spanish unit of the project (the target audience is 11-17 years old). Incorporating elements of character creation and dice rolling found in traditional RPGs, it has been specifically designed to address the game's objectives and learning outcomes. Players assume the roles of politicians, journalists, scientists, or influencers, competing on a fictional social media platform to gain influence and promote media literacy. During the game, players earn points when they achieve certain objectives or goals related to their character's role and special abilities. “Social Media Fake News” is a card game designed to help players understand the features that can make a news story vulnerable and false. The goal is to be the first to run out of cards by constructing a fake news story. It is divided into news construction cards with elements such as striking headlines, emotional language, references for your story, polarizing phrases, and action cards that allow for strategic counterattacks on the news, causing opponents to eat their words. “Data Defenders” centers on a tower defense experience intertwined with a rich narrative and engaging mechanics, strategically designed to highlight media literacy during times of crisis. During the simultaneous threats of an alien invasion and a devastating pandemic, players assume the role of defenders tasked with safeguarding global data servers. The gameplay unfolds across diverse islands, each containing a key character in disseminating information in today's society and the game's universe. Players must deploy strategic defenses to contain the alien robots and stop the servers from being hacked. Featuring innovative elements such as the Data Analyzer mechanic, players can dissect and assess various media content for credibility and biases. Moreover, the Crisis Impact mechanic dynamically reflects the prevalence of misinformation, challenging players to manage the crisis effectively while developing their media literacy skills. The game is crafted with players aged 13 and above in mind, appealing to teenagers and young adults who enjoy mobile gaming experiences. Additionally, we will focus on the study protocol accompanying the experimentation, and the in-depth analysis of the games and the video game during the test sessions designed with various research stakeholders, including adolescents, educators, and teachers, part of the latter group having already been involved as informed and knowledgeable subjects during the interviews administered in the initial phase of the project. Games and video games, then, are designed to foster critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and discussions about the impact of social media in a fun and engaging way, offering significant educational potential in promoting critical thinking skills and media literacy.},

  abstract = {Tabletop Role Playing Games (TRPG) are games that require players to become the characters they play through engaging in role-play. The challenge of training AI lies in the requirement of it not only understanding the explicitly stated game rules, but also the implicit ones that come with role-playing. Previous studies endeavouring said challenge allude to aspects of role-play, but do not emphasise its role in their methods, indicating that the definition of role-play and how it is to be employed remains unclear. This short paper aims to investigate a proposed definition of role-play based on previous research and employ its use on Large Language Model LLM, eliciting an understanding thereof through a novel prompting method dubbed Controlled Chain of Thought (CCoT). CCoT allows for the LLM to highlight absence of information in inputs given to it by generating questions, which become the template for its chain of thoughts when answered. This paper presents an initial pilot testing of CCoT as well as opens up the discussion of how a definition of role-play can be beneficial for future studies.},

  abstract = {Teaching AI to play Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TRPG) is a difficult challenge due their negotiable rules and open-ended nature. This is further exacerbated when considering the act of roleplaying, where players do not play or act as themselves, but as a character in a fantasy setting. Previous studies attempting to teach LLMs to play TRPGs do not explicitly discuss role-play in their work, highlighting an absence of a definition in current research. This thesis endeavours in introducing role-playing to AI through developing a prompting method called Control Chain of Thoughts, aimed at teaching it the Dungeons and Dragons alignment system. The prompting method is evaluated through an ablation study where GPT-3.5 is tasked to guess the alignment of characters based on exctracts from D\&D gaming sessions. The results indicate a small improvement in GPT’s predictions. Further work needs to be done to evaluate if its alignments help LLMs understand roleplaying.},

Although some research is available on communication in computer mediated role-playing games, little exists on communication practices in tabletop role-playing games. In my research, I reviewed existing scholarly literature on tabletop role-playing games, as well as theory on the role language plays in constructing reality. I conducted passive participant observation on a group of people playing Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. By applying theory to my ethnographic research, I demonstrated how players constructed a collective reality through communication. Players did this by demonstrating their own enthrallment with the game and by sharing a language code.},

Examining D\&D as an imaginary, I explore how its mechanics and fiction create categories of race through a process of profiling that produces sumptuary codes, perpetuates a racial hierarchy, invokes racialized accounts of biology, and constitutes a racialized gaze. Through stressing the continuity of this fictional account of race with real world racecraft, I analyze how the fiction of D\&D fails to imagine beyond the condition of race. This fiction thereby operates as a mirror that reflects back to us the difficulties of thinking beyond such racial logics, reaffirming the need for continued critique and a reimagining of race.},

  abstract = {The analysis of socio-legal problems through role-playing: an approach from law and literature Studies on law and literature have shown that both disciplines can have different points of contact, including descriptive dimensions (on the content and debates of law in literary works) and criticism (alluding to the generation of empathy through experience of the impact of law on the life of the characters in the works or referring to the interdisciplinary explanation of certain phenomena). The synergy between law and literature is possible, among other re asons, due to the fact that human experience can be considered as a nomos in which socially constructed normative issues have a present frequency. If role-playing games are understood as phenomena of literary “text”, therefore susceptible to dynamics of interaction with questions alluding to socio-legal phenomena, it is possible to use the lessons on law and literature to obtain, among others, two Objectives: a didactic one, teaching about law and its debates, and a critical one, encouraging questions about the aspects studied. The above is more feasible when addressing the narrative and simulation dimensions that role-playing games can have, especially due to the influence of the notion of agency in them, which allow for “experiences” in which the impact of the law is identified. (or his absence) about characters and third-party stakeholders. This type of interactions also allows sensitization and empathy to those who lack effective normative protection in phenomena similar to those that occur in real life. The above statements are confirmed with a case study: the reference to the world of Eberron.},

The students decided that they would like to adapt Dungeons and Dragons for their classroom project, which presented a unique opportunity to integrate the content and skill objectives in math, social studies, and writing into the design and play of the game. Students decided which elements of the game to adapt, what steps to take to achieve these goals, and how to play their game. The teacher provided materials, asked questions, and assessed the students’ progress to ensure that these cross-curricula goals were achieved. While all of the students benefited from engaging with this project, significant positive outcomes were observed in many students who struggled in math, reading, writing, and social interaction.},

  abstract = {Objective: Role-playing games elicit narratives of heroism, mastery and agency. These are factors considered to promote mental health recovery. This study investigates whatthemes emerge from the stories of role-playing game players in recovery from mental health difficulty and how their stories reflect existing models of mental health recovery.Method: This study utilised narrative inquiry to understand the experiences of Dungeons and Dragon players in recovery from mental health difficulties. Thirteen Dungeons \& Dragonsplayers (M = 33.31; SD = 10.05) were interviewed about their experience with the game and recovery. Analysis of narratives was conducted inductively and deductively.Result: Participants discussed a number of factors that linked Dungeons \& Dragons to their mental health wellbeing. These included a) experiencing through characters, b) skill building, c) finding space from mental health symptoms, d) safely engaging with mental health difficulties, and e) building relationships. All five stages of the Psychological Recovery Model (Andresen, Oades \& Caputi, 2003) were present, and participants engaged with Dungeons \& Dragons in a manner reflective of their mental health recovery process. Conclusion The current study expands on research that conceptualizes recovery asa multidimensional process and highlights new elements that have implications for consumers and theoretical frameworks.KEY POINTSWhat is already known about this topic:(1) Mental health difficulties can severely impact a person’s quality of life and disrupt their internal narrative.(2) Mental health difficulties can severely impact a person’s quality of life and disrupt their internal narrative.(3) Community based activities can foster a sense of growth, self-mastery and agency that may ultimately lead to identity reconstruction and a sense of personal recovery.(4) Role-playing games have been identified as potentially helpful in assisting people with mental health difficulties restore a sense of agency and positive identity.What this topic adds:(1) Australian Dungeon and Dragon (D\&D) players with a history of mental health difficulties were interviewed in regards to their experiences of role-playing and their mental health recovery.(2) Participants reported D\&D assisted with building relationships with other players, experiencing emotions through their character, developing adaptive skills, engaging with difficult mental health topics and experiencing a safe space from mental health difficulties.(3) All five stages of the Psychological Recovery Model were present, and participants engaged with D\&D in a manner reflective of their mental health recovery process.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and specifically Machine Learning has been put to use for years in the context of virtualizing board games. However, most of the current uses are typically applied to representing individual players or in-game agents; resolving tasks such as path finding or strategy. In the genre of more complex Role Playing Games there is another entity other than the normal player, the Game Master (GM). The GM’s role is to not only serve as controller of the player’s in-game adversaries, but also to construct the world, story, and scenarios the players are engaged in. It is not the goal of the Game Master to defeat the players (though this certainly can happen), but to create a challenging and fun experience for the players to engage in within the game’s rule set. It is the goal of this thesis to encapsulate the thought process of a GM when it comes to constructing the game regarding what types of scenarios to present to players next after a sequence of completed scenarios. This requires the very human process of reading players’ current engagement and attitude towards the previous sequence of scenarios in order to maximize their continued enjoyment. While previous studies have investigated altering games in real time to increase fun, these have all focused on manipulating the traits of the games’ Non Player Characters (NPCs) (such as speed or difficulty) or integrated this concept into procedurally generated level design for one player games. What is being proposed with the GM recommender system is capturing the human behavior of reading the moods of players and overall story design through scenarios to increase the “fun factor” of a group of players. It will act at the level referred to as the “meta-game” and determine what sort of scenarios that give the most enjoyment between combat, skill checks, and story components, as well as variables specific to each of those scenario types (such as difficulty).},

The installation provides the information one would need to run one organization within the setting of the world, and in addition has art and character sheets for a sample adventuring party. My research focused on identity and expression within the game, and I chose to express my findings through the characters I created and the story told within the text portions of the project. As I developed the project and the world behind it, I gained a clearer understanding of the universe I want to portray and create with my future work. The choice of materials stemmed from my own personal favourite way to create art - drawing on my tablet, and then a choice to incorporate more natural, realistic textures in the mismatched frames as a way to contrast my more stylized art and ground the piece in reality. The installation was created with love, stemming from my passion for my hobbies and my creations. It’s an expression of what I want to do and the worlds I want to build.},

In this way, libraries could become more welcoming spaces, more open to the public and much more interested in what the public wants. To find out what people think about the idea of playing games at the library, the idea of libraries using gamified activities or if the public would like to use gamified apps on the library websites, a questionnaire-based survey was administered on Facebook and WhatsApp between February 2 and February 8, 2024. Analysis of the answers obtained shows that the Romanian public is open to the idea of libraries where reading, communicating, socializing, acquiring knowledge in various fields such as literature, history, geography can be combined in a fun and enjoyable way with play, games and gamification. Respondents would also like to use gamification on library websites such as a book lending app.},

  abstract = {Dungeons \& Dragons is a popular tabletop roleplaying game, a genre in which players engage in logical, shared, structured fantasy predicated on certain fictional assumptions (Fine, 2002, p. 12). Dungeons \& Dragons is a collaborative and highly social activity, therefore requiring significant social investment and engagement by each member of the community (Adams, 2013, p. 77). Adams (2013) furthermore concluded that the game served as a “vehicle for players to consistently make an effort to socialize in structured ways” (p. 77). However, these communities continue to be associated with social ineptitude and further stigmatized by association with psychiatric disorders (Lis, Chiniara, Biskin \& Montoro, 2015, p. 381-382). I was introduced to a Dungeons \& Dragons community by a mutual friend. After an initial observation of several hours, I conducted preliminary interviews with both leaders (Dungeon Masters), in succession. Afterwards, I conducted a follow-up interview with just one of the leaders. This paper demonstrates the relationship between shared fantasy and collaborative consensus building, but pays particular attention to the unique jargon and conversational style of the community. I construct several taxonomies through thematic analysis, exploring the strategies gamers use to construct shared fantasy, and a shared repertoire based on crossmedia references, politics, and the history of the game. This paper furthermore analyzes the role of report-talk, a typically masculine conversational style that uses the exchange of information as a means by which to compete for and communicate status (Tannen 1991). I explore how these values and styles serve to alienate women and impede female participation.},

AP occupies an ambiguous economic space between fan production and professional media and is marked by widespread monetization. Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 24 AP producers, this article uses actor-network theory and the concept of cultural fields to understand that space through an account of the actors constituting it. This maps the how AP producers develop their practices through complex relational networks. The analysis identifies ‘key actor types’ – the varieties of technological, human and corporate actors whose activities give shape to producers’ practices. The article concludes that despite pervasive pressures to professionalize, the field offers limited pathways to vocational sustainability.},

  abstract = {"Actual Play" (AP) is a recent genre of online videos and podcasts focusing on unscripted play of tabletop roleplaying games (TRPGs). Its most popular exemplars, such as Critical Role and The Adventure Zone, account for large revenue streams and are important cultural actors in TRPGs recent surge in popularity. However, despite widespread monetization, only a tiny fraction of AP producers earn enough to make a career of AP. This dissertation approaches AP from a political economic perspective, analysing its composition as a field of cultural production, and exploring its producers' practices in relation to questions of creative labour and what David Hesmondhalgh and Sarah Baker term "good working lives." Building on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and in-depth qualitative interviews with 24 AP producers, it maps out relational networks with key actors that give shape to AP, including the TRPG industry, major brands like Critical Role and Dungeons \& Dragons, online distribution platforms, co-production networks, and audiences.  This account of the field undergirds an analysis of AP production as labour. The analysis indicates that AP producers are aware of the structural economic limitations of their craft, and underscores the importance of non-economic values, such as cultural participation, enjoyment, and community, in motivating their work. Despite AP's deep imbrication in processes of commodification and neoliberal structuration, this research speaks to its embeddedness in parallel economies of affect and play. The concluding chapter connects AP to broader evolutions in the creative economy, namely ubiquitous commodification and platformization of cultural production, and argues for the necessity of multilayered analyses of labour that are sensitive to questions of pleasure, community, and coping, as significant dimensions in the political economy of cultural production.},

  abstract = {Engaging with digital heritage requires understanding not only to comprehend what is simulated but also the reasons leading to its creation and curation, and how to ensure both the digital media and the significance of the cultural heritage it portrays are passed on effectively, meaningfully, and appropriately. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization defines ‘digital heritage’ to comprise of computer-based materials of enduring value some of which require active preservation strategies to maintain them for years to come.With the proliferation of digital technologies and digital media, computer games have increasingly been seen as not only depicters of cultural heritage and platforms for virtual heritage scholarship and dissemination but also as digital cultural artefacts worthy of preservation. In this chapter, we examine how games (both digital and non-digital) can communicate cultural heritage in a galleries, libraries, archives, and museums [GLAM] setting. We also consider how they can and have been used to explore, communicate, and preserve heritage and, in particular, Indigenous heritage. Despite their apparently transient and ephemeral nature, especially compared to conventional media such as books, we argue computer games can be incorporated into active preservation approaches to digital heritage. Indeed, they may be of value to cultural heritage that needs to be not only viewed but also viscerally experienced or otherwise performed.},

Unfortunately, there are few clear definitions of ‘world’ as it applies to commercial computer games, or as it could be used to help improvements these games. With that in mind, this paper will explore a framework for defining virtual worlds and then apply it to Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Figure 1) in terms of phenomenological, social, and cultural aspects. Even though it is a single player game, several key features allow Oblivion to be considered as a social world. Despite these promising features, Oblivion fails as a rich cultural world. It could be further improved as a social world and perhaps even as a cultural world through various techniques.},

Goffman's theory about how experience is structured by frames has shown to be a suitable perspective for describing involvement in games.

  abstract = {We present an overview of the beginnings of tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) play  in Chile in mid 90s. Prior to this, TRPGs were mostly played by small groups in  isolation from each other. This changed in the 1990s when TRPGs suddenly entered  the public eye and saw an increase in popularity and visibility. We discuss  particularities of the context that supported their avid acceptance and  dissemination. The nascent Chilean TRPG scene consisted of a motivated, organized,  and community-oriented generation of university-aged youth who partnered with  supportive local government and institutional organizations to organize and host  wide-ranging TRPG events in order to disseminate and share TRPGs as a hobby and  form of entertainment. We also comment on some particularities of the Chilean  context including the lack of a moral panic and strong institutional support. By  discussing and understanding the early history of TRPGs in Chile we can provide  insights into a local culture of play whose differences and similarities with others can  help us better understand the medium.},

  abstract = {This research aims to develop an Internet of Things (IoT)-based large-scale board game to enhance elementary school students' history learning. The game \&lt;Unveil Dutch Times\&gt; integrates role-playing, scenario design, and Internet of Things (IoT), and emphasizes player interaction and immersion to enhance learning with GNS theory. The game uses the historical background of the Dutch colonial period in Taiwan as the teaching content, and places students in scenarios based on real historical events, so that they can explore and solve historical problems from the perspectives of different characters, thus enhancing their understanding of and emotional connection to the historical events. The pre-test and post-test analyses of a class of 22 sixth-grade students showed that the students' understanding of history increased significantly after participating in the game. The students' overall response to the game experience was positive, and they found the game process interesting and educational. This research established that the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and role-playing board games can enhance students' sense of historical identity, enable learners to understand and empathize with various perspectives, emotions, and experiences of people in the past, and promote historical thinking and respect for diversity, thereby improving the effectiveness of history learning. This research provides a framework for teaching and learning that can be generalized to other history contents and curricula. This learning approach not only deepens students' understanding of history, but also stimulates their interests and engagement in learning.},

Many different flavors of multiuser text-based games exist, serving different audiences and featuring different affordances. Some focus on battling monsters (MUDs), some on social interaction with other players, and some on collective storytelling and role-play. MUDs operate from a variety of code bases and operational models. Outside of university environments, dial-up access was typically required either to access a MUD directly or to connect to an information service supporting the MUD. A major change moving from MUDs to MMORPGs is that games transitioned into being paid services as they became commercial ventures rather than hobbyist activities run by students and academics. The MMORPG section also includes a look at the co-creation of gaming, positive and negative effects, real money trading, and guilds.},

Curricular mode classifies learning experiences as addressing knowing, acting, or being, while system scale captures how learning experiences are aggregated into credentials. The paper argues that the curricular mode of being can be better implemented and credentialed within educational institutions if students learn to develop a self-narrative through navigating a multiplicity of learning experiences. Since narrative is implicit rather than explicit in existing university structures, the paper develops a speculative model based on role-playing games that integrates narrative and allows new forms of personalized credentials. The goal of the paper is to initiate a conversation around alternative curricular structures that allow emergent self-narratives within disciplinary structures.},

  abstract = {Social-emotional learning (SEL) is an essential area of development for adolescents. The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) presents a well-researched, broad, conceptual framework for systemic social and emotional learning (CASEL, 2020), which has been used to guide the development and implementation of the proposed pilot. It identifies five competencies of SEL: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationships skills, and responsible decision-making. The CASEL framework also emphasizes the importance of coordinating SEL across key settings and contexts—classroom, schools, families, and communities. Lack of SEL can have suboptimal effects during adolescence and later in life, consequently, impacting occupational engagement. A literature review on SEL found that appropriate SEL programming results in positive outcomes, such as improved school-related attitudes and behaviors, increased academic performance, decreased negative behaviors, and less reports of emotional distress (Durlak et al., 2010, 2011). Additionally, various school-related professions address SEL, however, there is limited evidence of occupational therapy practitioners’ involvement in the literature. Thus, adolescents’ occupational needs relating to SEL may not be being addressed. Play’s significance in developing adolescents’ skills is rooted in SEL. Play “develop[s] physical coordination, emotional maturity, social skills to interact with other children, and self-confidence to try new experiences and explore new environments” (AOTA, 2012, p.1). Dungeons \& Dragons® (D\&D) is a popular table-top role-playing game, which draws interest from many adolescents and adults. A second literature review found that play interventions for adolescents, and research using D\&D appears to be limited. Role for SEL is a play-based intervention group using D\&D (5th ed.) developed to promote SEL. In the pilot program, three to five middle-school students will participate in 90-minute after-school sessions, for 10 weeks. Participants will learn how to play D\&D, receive explicit instruction on two SEL competencies (self-management and relationship skills) and engage in D\&D scenarios and campaigns designed to support development in the relevant SEL areas. The author’s proposed pilot program has the potential to improve adolescents’ SEL and occupational engagement. This doctoral project discusses the case for the proposed pilot program, and presents a detailed overview of Role for SEL.},

La question de la méthodologie est certainement l’un des plus important enjeux des études critiques sur les jeux vidéo. Nous sommes souvent tentés d’étudier les jeux vidéo comme des objets à part entière, sans tenir compte de leur ancrage dans des jeux plus conventionnels. C’est pour cela que nous voulons faire une comparaison entre les jeux de rôle classiques et un jeu de rôle vidéo (Fallout 2, Interplay 1998). Ce mémoire veut montrer en quoi le jeu de rôle est une forme de jeu différente de tous les autres. Nous voulons donner au lecteur une vue des potentialités de ce type d’activité collaborative pour d'éventuelles études théoriques et critiques, en mettant notamment l’accent sur l’étude de ce concept mal défini qu'est l’interactivité. Le principal objectif de cette recherche est donc de présenter différents points de vue pouvant présider à une définition du concept d’interactivité. Ce mémoire se divise aussi en trois parties. La première présente le jeu de rôle classique et montre en quoi ce jeu peut être considéré comme un modèle d’étude pour la notion d’interactivité. La deuxième consiste en une étude du jeu vidéo Fallout 2. La troisième partie se développe autour d’une critique de la notion même d’interactivité et montre en quoi Fallout 2 peut être considéré comme un jeu interactif.},

In their eclectic cannibalization of various cultural others, these games instantiate the forms of late capitalist, postmodern culture. Nature plays an important part in this exotic simulacrum. Within fantastic worlds, druids, rangers, and other natureoriented characters engage a multitude of animals, monsters and humanoid creatures, as described in the animal catalogue of the Monster Manual. This bestiary pairs an assortment of exotic images with a rigorously quantified set of biopolitical rules. Through violently mastering this state of “bare life,” player-characters can advance in prestige and power. The proliferation of hybrid creatures means, however, that the “human” is not uniquely privileged—thus provoking the question of the position of the “animal” amid this seemingly subversive mélange of monstrosity.},

In the current study, an online questionnaire is used, adopting the verbal subtests of Wallach–Kogan Creativity Tests and the McCrae and Costa Big Five Personality Inventory. It is found that TRPG players score higher in divergent thinking tests. Priming and instruction giving methods lower the performance of all participants, in particular, when the instruction is memory provoking. ERPG players score lowest among the three groups. TRPG could be regarded as a form of improvisation. It could also be a preferable activity for the promotion of creativity. It is low cost and no formal setting is required to play. Many ERPGs are originated from TRPGs, therefore, with the popularity of ERPG, there should be advantages in promoting TRPG.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The vampire has become a fascinating character whose  distribution and consumption have been reinvigorated over the past two  decades thanks to series and sagas such as Buffy the Vampire  Slayer, Twilight and True Blood. Conceived from the same myth, these  three cross-platiorm products develop transmedia narratives in which  well-designed storyworlds, distributed across digital and analogue  channels, allow the engagement of the viewer, user and player. This  chapter proposes a case study of Vampire: The Masquerade as a  transmedia narrative. A product that combines a tabletop role-playing  game (RPG), live-action role-playing game (LARP), card game, television  series and two computer games. The chapter aims to highlight the role of  the narrative world as narrative engine. The chapter provides reflections  on how the cross-platiorm distribution of storyworlds, characterised by  performative aspects, can foster audience participation and exploit the  commercial success of a product.},

  abstract = {The trend of gamification holds a lot of potential for English language teaching and education in general. Given the variety of games available on the market today, it is imperative to consider each game genre separately for what it can offer to a particular class. This paper focuses on the genre of tabletop role-playing games and how the ELT classroom could profit from using their principles. The introduction of tabletop role playing games can positively impact on all four language skills, but the benefits stretch beyond this to sociolinguistic competence and promotion of a more relaxed atmosphere in the classroom. These positive aspects create a space which promotes learner-centeredness by motivating students to engage with the lesson through play. The paper also addresses the possible pitfalls of implementing tabletop role playing game principles and provides options for overcoming possible obstacles. Additionally, two observation studies are presented that show how the introduction of tabletop role-playing game principles can positively impact on the teaching and learning of English, one conducted in an after-school club and one in a class of university students of English. The former showcases how the environment shaped by tabletop role-playing games fosters the use of the target language. The latter provides us with insights into how students in an actual classroom respond to an activity which incorporates tabletop role-playing game principles. Both research studies support tabletop role playing games as positive additions to the arsenal of English language teaching activities.},

  abstract = {Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) has been a pervasive force in American culture for over forty years, and while it has frequently been examined as both social practice and cultural text, rarely have both the texts and the praxis of D\&D been studied with a focus on how race and gender interact within the game. This research looks at how race and gender intersect (or more often, contrast) within the text and practice of D\&D. This study culls data from a wide variety of sources. It includes literary analyses of important source material for the game, such as the work of J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard, describing the way these authors influenced the way the game understands and uses race. It also examines later works that both influence and have been influenced by Dungeons \& Dragons. This includes texts like Steven Erikson’s Malazan Book of the Fallen, a fantasy epic that began as a Dungeons \& Dragons campaign. In addition to textual analyses, this study includes data and observations taken from interviewing players and observing numerous sessions of D\&D. These interviews and observations are essential, as they provide information on how people talk, act, and think around the gaming table, and how players engage critically with concepts of race and gender in and out of the game. The ethnographic work in this study also provides critical information on the characteristics of D\&D gaming groups as social units, and how the social qualities of those groups impact the messages imparted during play. The basic conclusion of this study is that knowing that someone plays D\&D means very little, while understanding how and why they play D\&D is highly informative. While both ii D\&D’s origin as a game and its literary basis are marked by a predominance of white male voices, there is a surprising amount of flexibility in the stories that players can tell. While there is no guarantee that players will use their narrative freedom to tell morally uplifting stories (and they often do not) a great deal can be learned from understanding why people enjoy specific tropes and concepts.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a critical examination of how players of the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons use the concept of race, both in and out of the game. The study of race in role-playing games has been neglected, and this is a tragedy, because these games offer a unique space where the concept of race, often a difficult and uncomfortable topic of conversation, is questioned, criticized, and reshaped by the players. Role-playing games are spaces of encounter between the players and a cast of imaginary others, and this requires a degree of empathy on the part of the players that makes role-playing games a space of ideological change, as players are forced to consider the world from viewpoints both familiar and alien. The theoretical framework within combines a phenomenological analysis of roleplaying games that allows non-gamers to understand the practice and importance of these games with critical race theorists such as bell hooks, Paul Gilroy, and Patricia Hill Collins that defines what race is and how it affects all of us on a day-to-day basis. This thesis is also based on interviews with geographically diverse set of gamers who demonstrate the highly personal nature of gaming, and how race takes on a multitude of meanings both within the fictional game settings and around the gaming table.},

Nearly five years later, the course has changed names to BRDG (Bridges, the name of our core curriculum) 100 and my department has designed (and taught) five versions of it. We started with a very traditional in-person class, included an online version for students who could not fit the face-to-face class into their schedules, created a course meant to be taught in a Hyflex environment during the pandemic, and tweaked the classes that followed to address the changing needs of post-pandemic students.},

  abstract = {Language learners often face linguistic, cultural and interactional difficulties when studying abroad (Hanada, 2019). In particular, Japanese high school students of the author have expressed dissatisfaction that they only became comfortable in the setting in the latter part of their study abroad trip and that they felt the former half was “wasted time” as they struggled to interact. This project details the development of a role-playing game (RPG) designed to expose students to various real-life scenarios likely to be encountered on a study abroad trip (Australia in this case). Previous research has shown that role-play and simulations can prepare students for real-life situations (Hofstede et al., 2010), and gamification can increase motivation (Monterrat et al., 2017). This game uses the theoretical framework of Nicholson’s (2012) RECIPE for meaningful gamification (Reflection, Exposition, Choice, Information, Play, Engagement). The initial pilot study will run over ten one-hour sessions once a week after school, prior to departure. Students create a player character (PC) and decide several goals they aim to achieve during the game. Connecting via Discord, a student from the partner school in Australia acts as the game master (GM) and leads a group of 3-4 students through the various scenes, describing what is around and playing the role of all non-player characters (NPCs). Images, maps, and other realia are shared on Discord to provide the PCs with context. PCs can freely interact with objects and NPCs based on their goals and interests. A heavy focus on reflection/debriefing allows students to re-evaluate situations and discuss practical ways to overcome difficulties. Discord saves all shared data so students can freely review aspects between sessions. Upon return from abroad, student feedback will be used to improve scenarios and add relevant interactions based on the real-life struggles of students.},

The results show that there is a strong negative correlation between age and wanting to learn the rules of Call of Cthulhu through the introductory gamebook Alone Against the Flames. Another major reason for playing these solo gamebooks was the difficulty in gathering a group to play traditional Call of Cthulhu. This problem seemed to affect older players more than younger ones.

  abstract = {There is a paucity of research related to the motivation of people who play table-top role-playing games (TRPGs). Two questions drove this research: (1) What motivates people to play TRPGs and (2) Can a single supra-motivator be developed which envelopes a larger theory of why people participate in TRPGs? Grounded Theory methodology was used to investigate why people initiate and continue to participate in table-top role-playing games. Fourteen people who attended a 4-year college who played TRPGs and two people who did not play were interviewed regarding their participation in role-playing games. Open codes, emergent categories, conceptual categories, and a theoretical category indicated there exist two conceptual categories related to why people initiate participation in TRPGs and five conceptual categories related to why people continue to play TRPGs. These categories were linked together to develop the theoretical category of “becoming” to explain the motivations of people who play TRPGs. The emergent theory of becoming as motivation, limitations, and future directions for research are discussed within the interpretive context and research context. © 2017: Darrin F.

  abstract = {“Actual-play” and “narrative-play” are some of the terms currently used to describe a fledging format of storytelling which has risen to some online prominence through the past decade. To provide a summarized definition, “actual-play” is a serialized, unscripted and collaborative form of storytelling comprised of filmed ‘sessions’ of tabletop role-playing games, in which one participant serves as the Game Master (or Dungeon Master, or Storyteller, depending on the specific game system), functioning as a narrator of sorts, while the other participants – the Players – embody each a character of their own creation. Role-playing games (Dungeons \&amp; Dragons being the most famous among them) gained popularity during the 1980’s, and have always involved some measure of storytelling. The emergence of filmed role-playing as a narrative genre streamed to a wide audience, however, has been made possible only through online streaming platforms such as YouTube and Twitch and their decentralized approach to content creation. As a narrative format, actual-play’s collaborative and improvised nature means that pre-prepared text, visual or audio resources may play a part in the weaving of the story, but the lion’s share of settings, objects, and character’s movements and actions in space must be represented verbally. As such, ekphrasis plays an important part in role-playing as a game, and actual-play as a storytelling genre. The expression “theatre of the mind” has been utilized by the RPG community describe game situations where no visual resources are available, and the participants must track the scene in their own minds. Thus, the success of any tabletop role-playing game experience, and of actual-play as a genre is heavily reliant on players and audience members all achieving enargeia, and sharing, in their minds, similar images of spaces, objects and movements that have been verbally relayed. In order to reflect on roleplaying games and actual-play storytelling as particularly intermedial formats, I will depart from the modality modes (Elleström) and existing considerations on the medialities of games (Makai) in order to look into how ekphrasis, as a rhetorical device that stretches back to ancient Greece (Webb, Führer), appears here in a digitally streamed storytelling context.},

  abstract = {This volume will convince readers that the swift ascent of the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons to worldwide popularity in the 1970s and 1980s is "the most exciting event in popular culture since the invention of the motion picture." Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy presents twenty-one chapters by different writers, all D\&D aficionados but with starkly different insights and points of view.  It will be appreciated by thoughtful fans of the game, including both those in their thirties, forties, and fifties who have rediscovered the pastime they loved as teenagers and the new teenage and college-student D\&D players who have grown up with gaming via computer and console games and are now turning to D\&D as a richer, fuller gaming experience. The book is divided into three parts. The first, "Heroic Tier: The Ethical Dungeon-Crawler," explores what D\&D has to teach us about ethics and about how results from the philosophical study of morality can enrich and transform the game itself. Authors argue that it's okay to play evil characters, criticize the traditional and new systems of moral alignment, and (from the perspective of those who love the game) tackle head-on the recurring worries about whether the game has problems with gender and racial stereotypes. Readers of Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy will become better players, better thinkers, better dungeon-masters, and better people. Part II, "Paragon Tier: Planes of Existence," arouses a new sense of wonder about both the real world and the collaborative world game players create. Authors look at such metaphysical questions as what separates magic from science, how we express the inexpressible through collaborative storytelling, and what the objects that populate Dungeons and Dragons worlds can teach us about the equally fantastic objects that surround us in the real world. The third part, "Epic Tier: Leveling Up," is at the crossroads of philosophy and the exciting new field of Game Studies. The writers investigate what makes a game a game, whether D\&D players are artists producing works of art, whether D\&D (as one of its inventors claimed) could operate entirely without rules, how we can overcome the philosophical divide between game and story, and what types of minds take part in D\&D.},

Students demonstrated an engagement with the extant knowledge base of drama therapy as well as an interest in the current trends of empirical drama therapy research. Furthermore, students’ theses expanded the field of drama therapy by applying drama therapy in novel settings or with seldom-researched populations, as well as creating new or expanded methods and theories of drama therapy.

Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers, J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Marvel's Spiderman, and the complex stories of such television shows as Dr. Who, The Sopranos, and Lost all present vast fictional worlds. Third Person explores strategies of vast narrative across a variety of media, including video games, television, literature, comic books, tabletop games, and digital art. The contributors--media and television scholars, novelists, comic creators, game designers, and others--investigate such issues as continuity, canonicity, interactivity, fan fiction, technological innovation, and cross-media phenomena. Chapters examine a range of topics, including storytelling in a multiplayer environment; narrative techniques for a 3,000,000-page novel; continuity (or the impossibility of it) in Doctor Who; managing multiple intertwined narratives in superhero comics; the spatial experience of the Final Fantasy role-playing games; World of Warcraft adventure texts created by designers and fans; and the serial storytelling of The Wire. Taken together, the multidisciplinary conversations in Third Person, along with Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin's earlier collections First Person and Second Person, offer essential insights into how fictions are constructed and maintained in very different forms of media at the beginning of the twenty-first century.},

Despite selling over 250 million copies worldwide and becoming the fourth most popular children's series of all time, the CYOA phenomenon has yet to be placed in its larger social, economic, historical or cultural context. When explaining the rise of interactive narratives, previous literature has mostly focussed on technological change – namely the invention of video games, computer consoles and hypertext narratives. Moving away from such claims, this article demonstrates how the incredible success of solely text-based CYOA books stemmed largely from the cultural ascent of individual market choice to the heart of American notions of agency, liberty, subjectivity and selfhood in the 1970s and 1980s.},

  abstract = {Classroom role-play is an interactive learning technique with a long history of success, but current attempts to augment it with technology limit the very interactions that make this technique successful. For example, digital role-play games often engage individual students at a computer, rather than creating rich social interactions among students. In order to design interactions that better support the core aspects of classroom role-play, we conducted interviews with teachers; we also interviewed role-play gamers to discover how traditional RPG techniques and technology can be used to enhance classroom role-play. In this paper we 1) explore the reasons instructors choose role-play for learning, such as giving students practice opportunities; 2) identify barriers to instructors using classroom role-play activities, such as time constraints and student discomfort; 3) report issues around integrating technology, such as the benefit of reducing cognitive load and the threat of distraction; and 4) highlight two areas where insights from role-playing games can inform the design of interactive learning systems for classroom role-play: by providing methods for emphasizing group success over individual achievement and by preserving the spirit of the experience.},

  abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of this study was to explored the use of a tabletop role-playing game in middle school ELA classrooms to examine students’ (n=36) abilities to interact with and make meaning from a traditional classroom text (Richard Connell’s “The Most Dangerous Game”)., Background.Gaming continues to soar in popularity, both inside and outside of schools. As such, it is important to continue looking for pedagogically beneficial ways to incorporate gaming into classroom spaces, specifically English Language Arts and Literacy classrooms., Aim. In this article, we describe the game used for this study was modified from the Pathfinder system and designed to pair with Connell’s short story. We also discuss our qualitative approach to data analysis, and the three themes that emerged. First, students made gaming decisions based on their knowledge of the story. Second, students experienced the narrative through the lens of their characters. And third, students engaged in meaningful collaboration throughout gameplay., Conclusion. The findings support ongoing calls to look for pedagogically beneficial ways to incorporate gaming into ELA and Literacy classroom spaces.},

  abstract = {Currently, game research is characterized by the (re)construction of contested boundaries such as the “magic circle” of the game experience. These boundaries create dichotomies, for instance, between the real and the imaginary that hide the complexity of actual play, design and research. In this thesis I propose to go “beyond the magic circle” in order to understand games and play from a network perspective. My case study is role-play in the online game World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment 2004), whereby players act out the roles of their Fantasy characters. I understand Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) as networks of social interaction in which players (human actors) interact both with each other and with the system (nonhuman actors). Through interaction, role-players are creating meaning and social bonds that stretch out far beyond dichotomies such as in-character and out-of-character, in-game and out of game, real and imaginary, leisure and work or education, virtual and material, online and offline. The emergence of Fantasy role-playing games, of which the pen and paper game Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D, 1974) is the first and World of Warcraft (WoW, Blizzard Entertainment, 2004) is one of the latest incarnations, ties in with the development of what sociologist Manuel Castells termed the network society. Through rich empirical case studies in his trilogy The Information Age: economy, society and culture (1996, 1997 and 1998), he mapped how since the late 1960s we have been witnessing a shift from hierarchies to networks in all sectors of society. Castells’ work is part of a growing body of network theory in which our society, including science itself, is understood as a complex system shaped by processes within and between actor networks that are often powered by information and communication technologies. In order to study MMORPGs as networks, I made use of Actor Network Theory as it is formulated within science and technology studies (Callon 1986, Law 1987, Latour 1987, 2005), Thomas Gieryn's concept of boundary work (Gieryn 1983, 1999), Erving Goffman’s work on social interaction (Goffman 1956, 1974), and the concept of “situatedness,” a crucial addition that Donna Haraway made to network theory, which aims to make visible how scholars are positioned in constantly morphing network structures (Haraway 1991). This thesis contributes to 1) an understanding of online role-playing games as networks that interact with daily life, Fantasy game culture, and the broader technological and socio-cultural developments over the last thirty years; 2) a description and analysis of role-play as a specific MMORPG play style that is characterized by its negotiation principles, and thus to understand the roles, conventions, identities, and interpersonal relationships that self-proclaimed role-players negotiate in and through the systems of a commercially distributed game; and, finally, 3) an understanding of how collaborative play, design, and game research are closely intertwined. Going “beyond the magic circle” has profound implications for both epistemology and education in game research and design. A network epistemology asks for interdisciplinary academic work that combines not only scholarship from the humanities and social sciences, but also from computer sciences. Furthermore, it calls for a societal contextualization of scholarship and a connecting of fundamental and applied theorization both “inside” and “outside” academia, done by players, designers, and academics, roles that more often can be found in one person. A networked education teaches a specialization in the context of other research and design disciplines, as the ability and passion to create unexpected blends is crucial for future innovative developments in play, design, and research.},

Main research themes are the construction of game/play space and identities. Within this context I elaborate in this paper on the usefulness of the term magic circle (Johan Huizinga). I will argue why in game research the current use of the term magic circle is problematic. We can understand the term differently when returning to the context in which Huizinga introduced the magic circle as ritual play-ground. According to him ritual is play and play is ritual. Referring back to his work Homo Ludens (1938) I will discuss the various relationships between role-play and ritual performance. I will argue that fantasy role-playing consists of collections of performances or ritual acts, in which players construct the game/play space, identities and meaning.},

  abstract = {Role-playing games (RPGs) are storytelling games that employ character generation, improvisational acting, and rule-based interactions to build worlds and coauthor narratives. Contemporary education research identifies RPGs as robust examples of school-based and extra-academic literacy practices. As sites of narrative possibility and precarity, RPGs are political projects that can resist and reify hegemonic ideologies of race, gender, and power. In this three-paper dissertation, I build upon game studies and literacy scholarship to nuance the ways six youth participants coauthored worlds, negotiated storytelling practices, and (re)produced Whiteness. In Paper 1, I highlight a phenomenon I call “liminal play” – moments of gameplay wherein the boundaries between players, characters, and texts converge. My findings illustrate how liminal moments of play forward social and compositional dimensions of collaborative storytelling. In Paper 2, I leverage conversation analysis to detail how participants’ play-based talk oscillated across two participation frames: the game (i.e., their character roles) and the metagame (i.e., their player roles). My analysis examines the nested and contested processes of narrative negotiation inherent in RPG interactions. Finally, in Paper 3, I interrogate how participants’ worldbuilding practices resisted and reified White racialized ideology. Oriented by critical Whiteness studies, I unmask how participants and I privileged Whiteness despite our efforts to resist hegemonic Dungeons \& Dragons lore.},

Contributing to the burgeoning program of education research on RPG literacies, I used CA to study how six adolescent boys negotiated game-based storytelling across their character and player identities. Findings illustrated how participants’ metagame talk worked to negotiate knowledge, fairness, relationships, and pacing during RPG play. Implications of this work call for youth and educators to develop a reflexive awareness of metagame talk to better negotiate storytelling and power relationships during game-based coauthorship.},

And I am eager to learn more!"},

  abstract = {This chapter is a consideration of how we may approach the question of remediation in digital games, suggesting that we recognize how digital game remediation incorporates what are often more obvious elements from analogue game design into the more implicit infrastructure of digital contexts. Additionally, such remediation often exhibits “hypomediacy,” the denial of game design mediation, with important consequences for how useful digital games have become for institutional projects and their claims about reality. Anthropological treatments of ritual, and specifically how the engagement of audiences with ambiguous performances produces the real for participants, point toward important implications for digital games, where the infrastructural game elements may underwrite a similar process of reality construction through player performance. My overall suggestion is that when we give the cultural form of game its due (as we have for ritual and bureaucracy) – that is, when we incorporate a robust consideration of game features into our analyses – we will be in a better position to illuminate the ways in which our engagement with digital infrastructure is fraught with claims about the real.},

  abstract = {This study used a research through design method to examine time in roleplaying games, particularly with regards to the emotional impact of time skips as affected by various mechanical and narrative factors. The design in question drew from prior work in games, films, and other narrative works with time skips, based on the assumption that time skips can have a great emotional impact, but that impact may be lesser or greater depending on how it is handled. I based the design on a theoretical framework which suggested that roleplaying games would be more impactful given a deep immersion into the reality of the gameworld, and specifically a sense that time’s passage in the gameworld realistically reflected the way humans experience time in the real world. As such, the game was built to reflect specific theories regarding the human processes of memory and aging. The tabletop roleplaying game ran over the course of three 2.5-hour sessions over several weeks, with three participants roleplaying pre-built characters who aged with the time skip that occurred between sessions. Following the final session, I moderated a focus group interview to collect data about the emotional impact of the experience. Generally, the game did have a profound emotional impact. I found that the most impactful game elements were those which highlighted change on several levels; in particular, mechanics and narrative moments which emphasized character growth – or losses which characters had undergone – were very effective. Though this study used a tabletop roleplaying game as its medium, the design was built to be general enough that certain findings could be tested with other mediums as well, which I explore in the discussion section.},

  abstract = {"Every medium has been used to tell stories," says Eric Goldberg, one of my oldest friends and president of Unplugged Games. "That's true of books and theater and radio drama and movies. It's true of games as well." I have this argument all the time, and I think Goldberg's statement is balderdash. It's not true of music; music is pleasing sound, that's all. Yes, you can tell a story with music; ballads do that. So do many pop songs . Certainly some types of music -- opera, ballet, the musical -- are "story-telling musical forms," but music itself is not a story-telling medium. The pleasure people derive from music is not dependent on its ability to tell stories: Tell me the story of The Brandenberg Concertoes. Nor is gaming a storytelling medium. The pleasure people derive from games is not dependent on their ability to tell stories.  The idea that games have something to do with stories has such a hold on designers' and gamers' imagination that it probably can't be expunged, but it deserves at least to be challenged. Game designers need to understand that gaming is not inherently a storytelling medium any more than is music--and that this is not a flaw, that our field is not intrinsically inferior to, say, film, merely because movies are better at story-telling. Nevertheless, there are games that tell stories--roleplaying games and graphic adventures among others -- and the intersection of game and story, the places where the two (often awkwardly) meet has bred a wide variety of interesting game styles. Examining them is useful, because doing so illuminates the differences between game and story -- and the ways in which stories can be used to strengthen (and sometimes hinder) games.},

  abstract = {\emph{Magic, Monsters, and Make-Believe Heroes}  looks at fantasy film, television, and participative culture as evidence of our ongoing need for a mythic vision-for stories larger than ourselves into which we write ourselves and through which we can become the heroes of our own story. Why do we tell and retell the same stories over and over when we know they can't possibly be true? Contrary to popular belief, it's not because pop culture has run out of good ideas. Rather, it is precisely because these stories are so fantastic, some resonating so deeply that we elevate them to the status of religion. Illuminating everything from \emph{Buffy the Vampire Slayer}  to  \emph{Dungeons and Dragons} , and from  \emph{Drunken Master}  to  \emph{Mad Max,}  Douglas E. Cowan offers a modern manifesto for why and how mythology remains a vital force today.},

This article is divided into sections describing the games and the manner in which it has been applied to arts education. Interspersed within the article are reflections from the author's experience in a game that examines the politics of oppression called the The Tribunal, which resulted in introspection on both personal and societal issues. The article concludes that RPGs can help make both personal and communal meaning of experiences and foster the development of empathy.},

The most familiar surviving stories that connect us to our ancestors take the form of folklore and mythology. Games, too, have served many of the same functions as storytelling. In modern times, games and storytelling are no less prevalent, although the particular forms they take and functions they fulfill have been vastly expanded. Narrative gaming has become extremely popular, allowing for the consumption of both regional heritage and global multiculturalism. This essay will explore the roles of these contemporary narratives and provide an analysis of the transition from the traditional narrative to the live role-playing game.},

However, compared with many other genres of games, sports-themed videogames have remained relatively underresearched. Using the case of “sports videogames,” this article advocates a critical and located approach to understanding videogames and gameplay. Unlike many existing theorizations of gameplay, such as the “magic circle,” which theorize play as a break from ordinary life, this article argues for a consideration of play as a continuation of “the control of the established order.” It argues that many videogames, and in particular sports videogames, can be understood as “themed” spaces which share similarities to other themed locations, such as fast-food restaurants and theme parks. These are “nonplaces” themed to provide a sense of individuality, control, and escape in a society that increasingly offers none.},

  abstract = {A paper developing insights regarding gaming, the concepts of indigeneity and settler colonialism, artistic appropriation, and the field of psychotherapy. The writer engages in an intensive and sustained analysis of the psychic material (including dreams and active imagination) that emerges in relation to engagement with the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons Fifth Edition (Wizards of the Coast, 2014). The approach is phenomenological, and grounded in the psychology of C. G. Jung. The concepts of settler colonialism and indigeneity, discussed in response to the emergent psychic content, are explored in relation to one another as well as to gaming. Through the work’s continual reflexive turn toward its own content, insights are gained about the nature of gaming and the gamer’s psyche. As an offer toward the understanding of compulsive gaming-related psychiatric disorders (World Health Organization, 2018; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), it is suggested that a key danger of compulsive gaming may be its illusion of safety, providing a sense of potency, agency, and immersion in a magic circle (Huizinga, 1955) that is apart from reality. A multilayered understanding of the relationship between settler consciousness and indigeneity is developed. It is discovered that, in circumstances where imposing Indigenous values on an individual contravenes that individual’s genuine nature, this imposition can itself be a colonial act.},

  abstract = {This mixed methods paper reports findings from three studies examining the overlap between autism and hobbyist board gaming. The first was a quantitative survey of over 1600 board gamers, showing that autistic individuals are overrepresented in this hobby compared to the general population and that autistic traits measured by the AQ are significantly elevated amongst board gamers. Study 1 also assessed gamers’ motivations and preferences and reported key differences as well as similarities between autistic and non-autistic gamers. The second was a qualitative study that reported the results of 13 interviews with autistic individuals who are hobbyist board gamers. Using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), four key themes were uncovered, including a preference for systemising, escapism and passions, the social lubrication effect of games and difficulties with deception. In the third, 28 autistic individuals were introduced to board games in groups of 5–10 over an afternoon. Subsequent focus groups were then analysed using IPA. This analysis uncovered themes around how board games are challenging but encouraged growth and how they were an alternative vehicle for forging social relationships. Through this paper, we discuss how and why board games may be a popular hobby amongst the autistic population, and its potential utility for improving autistic wellbeing.},

This mixed methods study is an investigation of the  use of role-play in an undergraduate university course  designed to prepare students to become public school coaches  and physical education teachers. The five original vignettes  that were role-played were specifically written to prepare the  students to successfully handle situations they might  reasonably encounter in their future work. The role-play  model used in the research was originally created by the  Shaftels in the 1960s, but several creative variations devised  by the current investigators were added to that model for this  study causing it to be an adapted version. Data collected  included questionnaire responses from two different  questionnaires, information from a focus group, and  observations by the two investigators. Investigators concluded  that the students not only exhibited skill in the techniques  used to resolve the issues in the vignettes, but that students  gained confidence the more they participated in the role-plays  which occurred over a 4-week period. The students  themselves reported that learning from one’s peers, trying out  their ideas in a safe environment, being forced to plan an  intended outcome in advance, and hearing feedback from  others were their most valued experiences. They also  overwhelmingly reported preferring role-play to the more  traditional university lecture method.},

Their distinct anatomical characteristics and the variations therein among the recognized “species” of dragons make the taxa appropriate models for basic phylogenetic analysis in an undergraduate general biology or systematics class. The wyvern, an obviously more primitive, distant cousin of the “true” dragons, is also an appropriate outgroup for these estimations of shared evolutionary history. Separating metallic from chromatic dragons, the generated tree shows relationships among the species that are consistent with their separation in the Dungeons \& Dragons games according to alignment, scale color, and religion, three characters that are not used in the analysis. Manual construction of a character matrix and cladogram of dragons followed by repetition of this process via conventional computer software allows the students to track their progress not only in terms of understanding such concepts as choice of character states and parsimony but also in terms of the applicability of said software.},

  abstract = {In recent years, as Dungeons \&amp; Dragons has entered the mainstream American cultural zeitgeist, the use of role-playing games has exploded in settings such as therapy and education. There is anecdotal and emerging academic evidence that RPGs can promote personal growth of participants in both academic and therapeutic settings. However, it has been challenging to capture the impact of RPGs on learning in classrooms. We submit that this is because both the term “RPG” and the term “learning” are too broad. There are myriad RPGs available, with different skill sets required to play. Similarly, there are many different types of learning an educator may be looking to develop in their students. Building on the 1983 work of Gary Alan Fine, the 2008 work of Klabbers, and the 2011 work of Mariais, Michau and Pernin, we propose two things. The first is a schema describing the structures of an RPG within the educational context. The second is a matrix is designed to identify the kinds of learning that an educator wants to promote in students through use of Learning Role-playing Games (LRPGs) (Mariais, Michau, and Pernin 2012), then match that learning to specific elements within an RPG that will support those objectives. Educational objectives include specific content learning; social emotional skills such as turn taking or teamwork; executive functioning skills; math fluency; and reading skills. Future work will include application of this conceptual framework to actual classroom settings and potential use in therapeutic settings.},

  abstract = {Background The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a role-playing game (RPG) as a pedagogical tool for teaching beginning American Sign Language (ASL) to middle school students in a classroom setting. Methods In this qualitative study, n = 40 students participated in a 50-minute class centered on the ASL role-playing game, Inspirisles, for 45 days. To collect data on the student experience of the Inspirisles class, a post-process focus group was conducted with an external moderator and students (n =18) who chose to participate. Student responses were coded using applied thematic analysis. Results Students reported learning 50 to 100 words in American Sign Language, including numbers and the fingerspelling alphabet. Beyond language acquisition, they reported three main themes: a change in learning dispositions, positive social-emotional growth, and identification of important factors for success in continuing classes. Conclusion Students in the Inspirisles-based ASL class showed progress in learning ASL, with additional considerations for prosocial group learning in the classroom setting. However, further research is needed to see if this pedagogy is a viable option for long-term learning of ASL in the classroom setting.},

This paper aims to investigate this existing research into the individual differences in those who play role-playing games and provide a comprehensive review of research in the areas of demographics, interests, personality and identity as they pertain to gamers. The goal will be to investigate the extent to which the common perception of game-players stands up under investigation. The paper will also attempt to refute some of the more extreme and outrageous claims which have been made in relation to role-playing games – particularly those which involve crime, violence, murders, suicides and Satanism. The article will also examine child’s play and role-playing games in order to illustrate the importance of this style of imaginary play for identity development for both children and adults. The stereotypical image of role-playing gamers depicts them as anti-social male teenagers who are largely more interested in technology than in their own personal appearance, believing that they are highly intelligent and imaginative, passionate about topics which are uninteresting to their peers, and consequently persecuted by some of these peers. Through an examination of the research carried out in this area, the emerging image of a gamer is in fact that of an individual who does not necessarily fit into the stereotypical demographic of being a young male, and who is actively involved in developing his or her own personality and identity through participation in the games and also within the social networks that are often framed by these games.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, I investigate simple present eventive verbs in English improvised fictional narrative, specifically in the context of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). Previous work predicts that the English simple present is incompatible with eventives outside of limited semantic contexts (e.g. habituals) (Langacker 2001). I ask whether there is variation between tenses and aspects in TTRPG narration and how it may pattern. I also ask which semantic variety of the simple present is found in TTRPGs, using bicontextual semantics (Anand \& Toosarvandani 2019) to determine whether it is consistent with the limited previously theorized varieties, and whether and how those theories should be refined to account for this data. By building and analyzing a corpus of TTRPG gameplay transcripts, I find that the simple present is the dominant tense-aspect morphology used with eventive verbs in the corpus, and that third person singular present verbs appear in narrative contexts at a higher rate than other verb types do. I also find that all criteria are met for the TTRPG simple present to be considered a performative — with the modification that these new performatives can have non-first-person features as long as the utterer has agency over the actions of the subject of the utterance. These findings broaden the possible analyses of English tense and aspect semantics by drawing from underutilized data, and also provide linguistic evidence to support anthropological and literary conclusions drawn in previous work in game studies (Mackay 2001, Kawitsky 2020, i.a.) about the performative and agentive properties of TTRPGs.},

  abstract = {Game-based learning is supposed to motivate learners. However, to what degree does motivation driven by interest in playing an instructional game affect learning outcomes compared to motivation driven by interest in the very learning process? This is not known. In this study with a unique design and intervention, young adults (N = 128; a heterogeneous sample) learned how to control an electro-mechanical device in a 40-minute-long learning session integrated into a 2-hour-long educational live action role-playing game (edu-LARP). Edu-LARPs are supposedly engaging games where players take part in team role-playing by physically enacting characters in a fictional universe. In our edu-LARP, players had to understand how the to-be-learned device worked in order to win the game. Departing from typical game-based learning research, learning- and playing-related variables were assessed for each learner separately (i.e., a within-subject design). Affective-motivational factors related to playing (rather than learning) predicted learning outcomes in a positive, but considerably weaker, way compared to learning-related, affective-motivational factors. Developed interest in LARP-like games was primarily related to enjoying the game rather than better learning outcomes; whereas, developed interest in the instructional domain was primarily related to enjoyment of learning and better learning outcomes. Overall, autonomous motivation to play was connected to higher learning outcomes, but this connection was weak.},

Game developers helped to shape the market by incorporating RPGs into digital media; however, they suffered restrictions in their game design and storytelling caused by technological limitations. Fortunately, academia has studied these challenges and mitigated these latter issues to better understand and connect digital RPGs with their analog versions. Our research offers a comprehensive overview of studies centered on technologies for managing, generating, and controlling digital RPG elements. We aim to characterize Artificial Intelligence research within this domain and elucidate the diverse techniques employed. In this context, we examined 72 papers about Procedural Content Generation (PCG) in RPG, which were identified by mixing a database search with a snowballing method. In this paper, we provide an overview of PCG techniques investigated within the realm of RPGs and present the trending approaches for future developments in the field.},

Sabemos que com o passar dos anos a tecnologia evoluiu, transformando o cotidiano como conhecemos e causando mudanças em diversos aspectos da vida do ser humano, especialmente nos ambientes sociais e na vida cultural. Diante dessas mudanças causadas pela tecnologia e, principalmente, pelo ciberespaço, usando uma metodologia descritiva apresenta-se o jogo, a sua origem, como ele funciona, e um caso específico que trata o jogo no período do isolamento social provocado pela pandemia.},

  abstract = {Background. Several authors from different fields have already mentioned the educational potential of role-playing games (RPG). As tabletop role-playing games (TRPG) present some similarities with small adult groups in learning and personal development situations, what about their transformative potential? Aim. The purpose of this article is to describe the tabletop role-playing game’s emerging context, a few of its specificities and functions, to show links with several education, play and game, and personal development theories, and to raise awareness about its transformative potential. Methods. Three complementary approaches were used: a literature review (academics and role-players), action-researches through a transformative role-playing game (“TF-RPG” – a TRPG plus a debriefing), and data cross-analysis. Results. Participants are involved in the TF-RPG through four levels of reality, namely the character, player, person, and human being, which can be associated with four dimensions of learning: knowing, doing, being, and relating. The unveiling of links between the TF-RPG experience and their personal journey offers the participants various ways of learning and paths towards personal development. Conclusion. TRPGs are particularly effective to foster knowledge acquisition, develop role-play skills, strengthen team building, encourage collaborative creativity, and explore one’s personal development.},

  abstract = {This was a qualitative study of the experiences of Dungeons \& Dragons players at the Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) club at a private university in the Western United States. Previous research has shown that the benefits of playing Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs) include developing social skills, developing empathy, and finding respite from reality. The goal of this research was to identify how role-players perceive they are affected by TTRPGs and what is appealing about TTRPGs. The participants in this study identified that, as a result of playing TTRPGs, they learned to develop better social skills and empathy. Their top reasons for playing were engaging in prosocial behaviors, finding respite from reality, being able to express themselves and find acceptance, and finding personal enjoyment engaging in the game. The majority of these results followed the already existing research into the effects of TTRPGs. Areas that were not as readily represented in the literature were the prosocial behaviors that role-players engaged in that motivated them to play, finding respite from reality, and finding personal enjoyment with the game. Further research could continue to identify the effects that role-players experience over time, a longitudinal study to see what personal material role-players bring to their games, and any negative effects that come from TTRPGs.},

The affordances of TFRPGs allowed us to collect repeatable, targeted data in online field conditions. These data not only included terms that allowed us to build our maps, but also to explore nuanced ethical problems from a situated, collaborative perspective.},

  abstract = {This article examines the methods of discursive erasure of gender occurring in gaming spaces dominated by men. Tom Digby postulates a warrior masculinity honed among boys throughout their early experiences of gender socialization. This indoctrination valorizes manhood acts encouraged in male-dominated spaces. I use critical discourse analysis to examine 45 articles from Dragon magazine, a popular periodical associated with Dungeons \& Dragons. I highlight textual characteristics of gender erasure, including pronoun usage, characterization of women as sources of protection, and humor surrounding women’s issues to illustrate how women were sidelined in early gaming subculture. I argue a historical reduction of women’s participation and a persisting male preserve set the stage for the contemporary concerns about gatekeeping and poor treatment of women in gaming and other fandoms.},

I examine threads from a Facebook group discussing the topic, and code the reactions of men participating. I discuss how some gamer masculinities that are displayed reinforces a belief of epistemic privilege among White men that allows for hegemonic responses to discussions that involve structural racism. I propose larp gamer masculinity as a hybrid masculinity, complicit in its support of hegemonic models but appropriating elements of subordinated populations to allow individuals to feel like an “outsider.” In these gaming discourse spaces, men employ an anti-intellectualized form of digital hooliganism as a rationale for their claims. These men dismiss claims of discrimination as they see those as characteristics outside the scope of the game. The resistance exhibited by these men reacting to changes should be viewed differently than extremist discourses.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the nature of conversations that occur at gaming tables in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) and the degree to which gendered communication impacts how individuals participate in gaming sessions. There is a host of research discussing barriers for women and minorities in terms of full representation and interaction in gaming and “geek” spaces (Garcia 2017; Reagle 2015; Stang and Trammell 2019). I assert that one rationale for this limitation is the domination of gaming spaces by men, particularly middle-class White men, and the subculture that comes along with this demographic. Dunning (1986) discusses the concept of male preserves, how sports in particular create subcultures that prize behavior and language that are associated with men and embodied in the male form. I discuss how the TRPG table is a male preserve, encouraging a level of dominance that colors table talk and acceptable norms (Dunning, Murphy and Williams 2014). The masculine nature of the discussion style of this table talk is more difficult by subaltern groups because of the clear association with “stereotypical” gamers, commonly White and male, and this difficulty is demonstrated in various ways (Bowman 2013; Hendricks 2006; Ilieva 2013). I surmise that while diversity has always existed and proceeds to improve in tabletop gaming, the subcultural elements of a male preserve remain difficult to uproot.},

I critically analyze descriptions in the game materials that discuss in-game Black ethnicities. I demonstrate how the discourse represents a symbolic violence surrounding blackness. While the descriptions provide imagery and word use to highlight the positive aspects of the characters, the overemphasis signals stereotypes of a conceptual “other.” These characters then become examples of “good Blacks” that differ from “bad” individuals. The positive imagery provokes a stereotype threat, and a need to uphold this “good Black” mentality, lest one becomes the Other. While thinking of race and ethnicity in tabletop gaming continues to evolve, even advancements fall into tropes which reinforce symbolic violence.},

Metadiscourse involves conversation not linked to the current game but could be cordial and relational, critical, or completely unrelated to the game. However, it is an informal conversation that would not occur if there was no game. In metadiscourse there are determinations of gaming capital, or elements of value. Participation in metadiscourse allows an individual to feel included in the game and gaming subculture. However, metadiscourse demonstrates a level of gaming capital through situatedness and affordances that can act as a gatekeeping function for individuals.},

  abstract = {Abstract : This research focuses on how a specific game support, the roleplaying game, captures the historical material. Through the analysis of a game corpus, we aim at understanding the mediatisation process of historical knowledge (the translation of history into a medium) in a game-related perspective. Firstly, we consider the historiographical dimension of history. Historians’ reflections on their discipline, but also works on history as a genre, clearly show that the relation between historical knowledge and fiction/narrative is ambiguous. Secondly, we focus on the theoretical tools that may help us to find a connection between history’s seriousness and game’s triviality. As the approach and use of historical knowledge by a game-related medium are not involved with formal and pedagogic learning processes, we confront them to other theoretical tools such as studies about informal learning and the notions of knowledge circulation. Thirdly, we concentrate on the presentation of our research object: roleplaying game. Roleplaying game, which is an ambivalent field as well as a medium whose distribution is limited within networks of the mass gaming culture, has distinctive features such as the completeness and coherence of its imaginary worlds. The last part of our work aims at analysing these features and their relation to the mediatisation of historical knowledge by roleplaying games. The construction of fictional worlds “recycling” history and the setting up of game mechanisms reflecting play uses of historical resource appear as the two major elements driving the transformation process of historical knowledge into ludic knowledge. Finally, history mediatisation within roleplaying games should not be confronted to criteria of historical validity but should be considered as an appropriation process of knowledge via game-related fiction.},

Elle partage avec le jeu un certain nombre de caractéristiques, qui expliquent partiellement la fréquence de leur rapprochement. Parallèlement, les dynamiques culturelles et les évolutions médiatiques qui commencent à émerger dans les années soixante-dix constituent des facteurs d’explication non négligeables.

  abstract = {Le terme jeu de rôle est souvent mal interprété et méconnu. En effet, il est confondu avec toute sorte d'activités qui ne le concerne que peu, comme les jeux de rôles en entreprise, les thérapies psychologiques, etc. Ici, nous allons étudier le jeu de rôle sous sa forme première, en tant qu'activité créative dont beaucoup de caractéristiques peuvent se rapporter à des domaines littéraires, comme la narratologie. Pourtant, il n'existe en France que peu d'études littéraires sur le sujet, c'est pourquoi nous avons décidé d'y consacrer ce mémoire.   Nous avons porté notre choix de corpus sur trois œuvres:     - INS / MV: ce jeu français met en scène des anges et des démons qui vivent dans notre monde réel et contemporain. Ils se livrent une guerre ancestrale et secrète pour obtenir l'âme des êtres humains qui ne se doutent de rien. On peut jouer des anges ou des démons.    - Shadowrun: ce jeu américain prend place dans un univers cyberpunk, dans une réalité alternative dystopique. La magie est apparue après les années 2000, introduisant des éléments d'heroic fantasy. Le monde est contrôlé par des multinationales tentaculaires qui rivalisent pour acquérir de plus en plus de pouvoir. On y joue des mercenaires à la solde de ces "méga-corporations".     - Vampire: le Requiem: l'univers décrit par ce jeu américain est le même que le nôtre, à ceci près que certaines créatures surnaturelles (loups-garous, fantômes) existent et évoluent dans l'ombre. Ici on joue des vampires, êtres nocturnes torturées par leur condition.   Nous allons donc nous consacrer à la découverte du jeu de rôle en passant essentiellement par des exemples tirés de ce corpus, sachant que nous aurons également recours à d'autres jeux plus épisodiquement. Il s'agit bien ici d'une découverte, puisque peu de gens sont capables de définir le jeu de rôle selon des critères littéraires. Nous nous attacherons alors à répondre à la question suivante: en quoi le jeu de rôle est une nouvelle forme littéraire qui créé et régit ses propres caractéristiques et codes ?  D'abord, nous allons essayer de définir le jeu de rôle et de présenter les différentes écoles de pensées qui l'ont théorisé afin d'arriver à notre propre définition. Ensuite, nous tenterons de démontrer que les univers rôlistiques sont proches des mondes paralittéraires, genre auquel appartient sûrement le jeu de rôle. Enfin, nous étudierons les différentes techniques littéraires employées dans les jeux de rôles et les buts qu'elles s'efforcent d'atteindre.},

  abstract = {Cette recherche traite du jeu de rôle sur table comme moyen oral et collectif de création fictionnelle et littéraire. Elle montre que les JdR mettent en place des dispositifs ludiques qui obligent les joueurs à co-générer un contenu fictionnel diégétique et narratif, selon le principe qui est nommé l’intercréativité. L’intercréativité propre aux JdR fusionne les actes de création et de réception de la fiction et met en crise le rapport de la littérature à l’écrit. Dans un premier temps, nous étudions la manière dont s’est élaboré le concept d’intercréativité tout au long de l’histoire des JdR. Ensuite, nous les intégrons à un ensemble dont ils sont un élément fondateur, la culture geek. Nous montrons que le JdR est un héritier des littératures de l’imaginaire et qu’il fait la jonction entre ces deux sphères. Les JdR y sont également envisagés comme des mondes fictionnels intercréés, précurseurs d’une part des univers partagés et des jeux vidéo RPG, et d’autre part de la systématisation des mondes fictionnels qui induisent une réception interactive. Dans notre troisième partie, nous expliquons en quoi l’intercréativité fictionnelle mise en place par le JdR est un processus narratif et littéraire, une expérience collective et immédiate de la création de la fiction par le langage oral. Nous nous penchons sur les spécificités narratives de ce médium. Nous montrons également comment ces outils de création fictionnelle dépassent, pour certains écrivains, le cadre des JdR pour déboucher sur une création littéraire classique. Enfin, nous abordons le ludique comme un ensemble de dispositifs qui obligent les joueuses à créer un contenu fictionnel ensemble, ce que nous nommons l’intercréativité.

  abstract = {Cet article traite du jeu de rôle sur table comme moyen oral et collectif de création fictionnelle par le langage verbal, et interroge son rapport au littéraire. Il explique la manière dont les jeux de rôle mettent en place des dispositifs ludiques qui permettent, voire obligent, les joueurs à co-générer un matériau fictionnel démiurgique et narratif, selon le principe qui est nommé l’intercréativité. Ainsi, les jeux de rôle font de la réception une étape de création de la fiction. Mais peuvent-ils être considérés comme une forme de jeu littéraire oral et collectif~? Pour répondre à cette question, cet article analyse dans un premier temps le rapport qu’entretiennent littérature et jeu d’une façon générale. Ensuite, il étudie le JdR en tant que processus conversationnel, oral et «~présentifié~» qui génère une création fictionnelle collective. Avec l’intercréativité, c’est un rapport dionysiaque à la littérature qui ressurgit, alors qu’il avait été annihilé à l’ère moderne.},

The fiction-based religions discussed include Jediism based on Star Wars, Tolkien spirituality based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth saga, and Lovecraftian magic inspired by H.P.

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) provide a unique opportunity for the creation of LGBT+ characters and narratives. There is a gap in existing scholarship in this area, but the research that is available suggests that TTRPGs are likely to present LGBT+ themes in a manner that is biased to its authors views. This thesis aims to determine the ways in which TTRPGs engage with LGBT+ identities within their rulebooks, and the ways in which TTRPG players construct their LGBT+ characters as a result. This study utilises mixed methods research, combining analysis of rulebooks focused on queer theory and ludology, and a survey of existing TTRPG players in order to achieve the aims set out above. The result of this research primarily discusses a demographic of young, queer adults who have consistently played as at least one LGBT+ character within a TTRPG. Overall, this study found that indicates that the construction of LGBT+ identities within TTRPGs is ultimately a collaborative effort between the rules as written, and the player’s actionable usage of them within a game. With regards to the fluff reality of the game, this meant that players typically ignored game content in favour of creating their own, personalised lore to match their ideal game world. With regards to the mechanical reality of the game, this instead meant that, while rulebooks could provide a clear overview of the author’s intent towards the place of queer content within their game design, players could purposefully choose to ignore any information provided by the game, as they functioned as the final authority on what rules were allowed within the game.},

  abstract = {Esta pesquisa tem por objetivo investigar como o financiamento coletivo (FC) e as mudanças nas indústrias culturais implicaram transformações nas revistas especializadas em cultura pop. Para isso, fizemos um estudo de caso da revista Dragão Brasil (DB), a mais bem sucedida revista especializada em jogos de RPG do país, que conta com a participação ativa dos leitores e de grupos de fandom de jogos analógicos. A perspectiva teórico-metodológica desta dissertação está fundamentada a partir dos seguintes questionamentos centrais: de que maneira se constituem formas inovadoras de financiamento do jornalismo de revista, como é o caso da Dragão Brasil, e como essas iniciativas estruturam o campo jornalístico e mobilizam seus públicos para obter sustentabilidade? Para responder essas perguntas, percorremos a história das revistas de RPG e suas imersões na cultura da convergência, por meio de narrativas transmídia e exploração do trabalho de fã, por parte das editoras, a partir dos estudos sobre cultura participativa. Exploramos a fundo a revista Dragão Brasil, por meio do cruzamento dos estudos de jornalismo de revista, jornalismo de jogos e jornalismo de cultura pop; com um levantamento sobre a história do periódico e a relação com os fãs, feito por meio de entrevistas com pessoas-chave da editora responsável pela DB, e de um questionário aplicado para os fãs que apoiam a revista contribuindo financeiramente em campanhas recorrentes de FC. Os resultados mostram que a relação de confiança existente entre produtores e consumidores-fãs dos produtos criados e expandidos a partir da própria revista parecem ser a chave para o sucesso de iniciativas de financiamento coletivo no jornalismo cultural, uma vez que a participação ativa dos consumidores traz benefícios não só para estes, por fazerem parte da produção, mas principalmente para os produtores, que ganham com o fortalecimento da imagem de seus produtos, feito pelas próprias comunidades de fãs. Essa relação é, assim, intrínseca às práticas editoriais e comerciais da revista que, por sua vez, ao endossar o sentido de comunidade participativa, renovam os valores de uma cultura digital. This research aims to investigate how crowdfunding and changes in cultural industries have led to transformations in specialized pop culture magazines. To achieve this, we conducted a case study of Dragão Brasil (DB), the most successful RPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Games) magazine in Brazil, which actively involves readers and analog game fandom groups. The theoretical-methodological perspective of this master’s thesis is grounded in the following central questions: how do innovative forms of magazine journalism financing, such as in the case of Dragão Brasil, emerge, and how do these initiatives structure the journalistic field and engage their audiences to achieve sustainability? To answer these questions, we traced the history of RPG magazines and their immersion in convergence culture through transmedia narratives and exploration of fan labor by publishers, based on studies of participatory culture. We delved into Dragão Brasil magazine by intersecting studies of magazine journalism, game journalism, and pop culture journalism, conducting a survey on the history of the periodical and its relationship with fans through interviews with key individuals from the DB publisher and a questionnaire distributed to fans who financially support the magazine through recurring crowdfunding campaigns. The results indicate that the trust relationship between producers and consumer-fans of products created and expanded through the magazine itself seems to be the key to the success of crowdfunding initiatives in cultural journalism. The active participation of consumers benefits not only them, as they become part of the production, but also the producers, who gain from the strengthened image of their products promoted by fan communities. This relationship is intrinsic to the editorial and commercial practices of the magazine, which, by endorsing a sense of participatory community, renew the values of digital culture.},

Surveys were used to check changes in motivation and the results show that intrinsic motivation within the experiment group increased by almost 11\% and extrinsic motivation by 1\%. Amotivation became more neutral by approximately 2\%. Therefore it can be concluded that Realm of Knowledge was successful in increasing motivation for this specific experiment group.},

  abstract = {The multiple-choice video game Life is Strange was described by its French developers as a metaphor for the inner conflicts experienced by a teenager in trying to become an adult. In psychological work with adolescents, there is a stark similarity between what they experience and some concepts of existentialist philosophy. Sartre’s script for the movie Les Jeux Sont Faits (literally ‘‘games are made’’) uses the same narrative strategy as Life is Strange—the capacity for the main characters to travel back in time to change their own existence—in order to stimulate philosophical, ethical, and political thinking and also to effectively simulate existential ‘‘limit situations.’’ This article is a dialogue between Sartre’s views and Life is Strange in order to examine to what extent questions such as what is freedom? what is choice? what is autonomy and responsibility? can be interpreted anew in hybrid digital–human—‘‘anthrobotic’’—environments.},

Current computational IS models are based on investigations about how games are planned by game designers and actually played by the audience. Unfortunately, most research efforts are limited to the structured data for obtaining insights about IS models. This paper presents a study aimed at determining which actions modeled by Role-Playing Games (RPG) are more important for actual gameplay and how these actions are related. For doing so, we first extracted textual data from existing adventures found in a play-by-forum RPG portal. Such gameplay data is written in Portuguese and reflect natural gameplay without observer intervention. Our analyses from a natural language processing perspective provide valuable insights for IS models in reducing the gameplay chasm between electronic and tabletop RPG. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {A thesis presented on modern tabletop role-playing games and how they offer anthropologists a new way to approach issues of creativity, identity construction, social interaction, and the nature of play in American culture. In these games, players continuously challenge and redefine aspects of personal identity, social paradigms, gender identity, and reality construction. This thesis is exemplified by the interactions of two separate role-playing groups in Muncie, Indiana, as well as multiple interviews with gamers from many different areas. This idea is also clearly reflected in the interactions of role-players, both in their own personas and in character. Multiple layers of roles, in both the fictional world and within the social group of the players, are created, accepted, adapted, and discarded during the course of an average game.  Gamers’ voices are emphasized, rather than game play itself, in order to explore how gamers feel and think about their play. Both Ludology and Carnival are explored as possible ways to approach the subject. Play in general allows individuals and/or small groups the creative space to form new strategies to enact personal and cultural change in the reality outside of the game; while tabletop RPGs allow players the liminal space to explore different aspects of their personal identities, even as they create an outlet for challenging social strictures. Negative cultural labeling of these games as deviant and subversive has created the illusion of secrecy that helps the games to function in this manor. The importance of both play and narrative become obvious when speaking to gamers about their hobby; allowing the gamers to form a sub-culture based on the shared experiences of the games. And it is in these shared experiences that the gamers find the power to alter their real-life self images, and experiment with change.},

Though art has been recognized as therapeutic both in the psychological and cultural realms for generations, it is now essential to infuse dramatic storytelling practices into the pedagogies and curricula of our grade school classrooms.The isolation created by pandemic shutdowns \&amp; social distancing, sociocultural \&amp; political warfare in the U.S., and social media addictions, leaves us with less and less time to connect on a basic human emotional level. Dramatic storytelling provides an opportunity to build community, self-reflect, and find growth and healing.During an eight-week period, I executed a dramatic storytelling workshop through the ArtsBridge America fellowship program at UC Santa Cruz, which connected me with a local, underfunded public school. Through documentation of the lesson plans, reflections on the classes, and analysis of the students' experiences, I argue for implementing dramatic storytelling as a necessary and invaluable power.},

The irony for Christian critics of DD, such as Schnoebelen, is that the philosophical and theological arguments of Christian traditionalists, such as Thomas Aquinas and J.R.R. Tolkien, provide some of the strongest arguments in favor of DD role-playing. However, to be fair, these same arguments can be used to argue that a particular DD game, under certain circumstances, can be bad. “Postmodernists” refers loosely to a group of philosophers and thinkers who question, if not outright reject, the core tenets of the traditionalists. If the traditionalists have the correct metaphysics about the real world, then it follows that DD is good, but that care must be taken to make sure the game does not become morally objectionable.},

  abstract = {Dungeons \& Dragons, known colloquially as D\&D, is a fantasy role-playing game that builds a space for collaborative story-making and gameplay. It also has immense potential to contemplate game structure and play elements as considered within various discussions regarding videogames and role-play. Simultaneously it has the potential to bridge these considerations with the discussions of speculative fiction that have emerged contemplating the impact of imaginative worlds. As an increasingly popular element of our culture, the lack of analysis of D\&D and other role-playing games, especially in discussions of speculative fiction, should be rectified. As individuals are disappearing into vibrant fantasy worlds like the ones built through D\&D, more analysis of them is important. D\&D as a collaborative fantasy world requires immense social interaction and the creation of imaginative elements structured through game rules. It has the potential to provide a lot of anthropological rich data on gameplay, identity creation and maintenance, and collaborative world-building. This paper seeks to tease through the elements of gameplay and world-building to understand the cultural richness built through D\&D campaigns and structurally examine how D\&D is played. Furthermore, I seek to understand how the culture building taking place in this game space has the potential to be deeply impactful in how individuals view and understand our world.},

TTRPG makers have long provided instructions on how to (role)play in the form of scripted vignettes of game sessions. More recently prospective players have been guided towards “Actual Play” podcasts or video series. Drawing on a range of Actual Plays in both printed and audio- visual formats, as well as player comments and discussions, this article reflects on the ways that such representations of role-playing imply or construct gameplay norms, and how these norms shape player expectations and experiences. Grounded in perspectives drawn from film and media studies, it pays particular attention to the form of mediation in each case, seeking to understand how different presentations of play afford different interpretations of what role-playing is and might be, and the implications of this for the present and future of this game form.},

Lovecraft (1890-1937) a créé dans ses récits d’horreur une géographie parallèle de la Nouvelle-Angleterre, où des localités imaginaires comme Arkham ou Innsmouth côtoient des lieux réels. Les continuateurs de son œuvre ont repris et étendu son imaginaire non seulement dans le domaine littéraire, mais aussi dans le cinéma, la bande dessinée, et le jeu de rôle. C’est surtout dans ce dernier domaine que des cartes de la géographie lovecraftienne ont été produites en grand nombre. Je propose d’examiner comment ces cartes s’articulent avec la fiction de Lovecraft, en étudiant plus particulièrement le court roman Le Cauchemar d’Innsmouth. Je suggère que les cartes peuvent être regroupées en trois catégories, selon la fonction qu’elles remplissent, et selon leur style graphique. Cette abondante production cartographique produit des effets à la fois sur notre lecture de Lovecraft, et sur notre perception des espaces réels.},

Subject and methods: This research focuses on the practice effects of “Pixels” and “Passerelle” workshops at CThA. It is about the use of video games as a therapeutic tool, mobilizing of the symptomatology of the teenager. Results: “Pixels” workshops use playing according to three specific forms: the paper role-play game, the video game, and the cards playing game. Their specificity is that the participative adult shows a regressive ability strong enough to play with teenagers and is very careful to not interpret what takes place within. Conclusions: “Passerelle” workshops demonstrate the link between the teenager’s mind and the use of his own virtual avatar. It allows to evolve from a “play together” to a “talk together”, a moment of symbolization and of being able to stand back in regards to his or her own recreational activities. As a discussion, this clinical illustration of Karl recovering from depression and dependency. This setting for speech allowed him to evolve into an impulse mood and to reconnect emotionally.},

They take a fundamental form of play – make-believe – and a fundamental aspect of social reality and identity – roles – and give them the structured form of a game. RPGs involve play. Play transforms and recombines other, functional behaviors, exaggerating, varying, and rendering them incomplete so they lack their "serious" consequences and thus their obvious instrumental or survival value. RPGs involve roles, another universal human phenomenon that has been studied for over a century. Roles are patterns of behaviors and attitudes expected from a person occupying a given social position. In terms of play, RPGs provide insight into adult pretense and role-play, which occur in many places besides RPGs: many board, card, and video games have moments of emergent micro-role-play.

  abstract = {Talking Miniatures is an exciting new book about the early years of Games Workshop and Citadel Miniatures. Written and compiled by former White Dwarf Editor and Design Studio Manager – Robin Dews, and ex-Citadel/GW Sales Director, now Head of Warlord Games - John Stallard, the book consists of a series of lavishly illustrated conversations with some of the eclectic cast of designers, sculptors, artists, rebels and similar non-conformists who in the early 1980s gravitated towards Bryan Ansell and the early Citadel Miniatures team. More a collection of conversations than a series of interviews, Talking Miniatures, allows the participants to tell us in their own words, exactly what it was like in those very early years. How did that first edition of Warhammer Fantasy Battle come to be written? Who was behind the incredible look and feel of the original Warhammer 40,000 – Rogue Trader? How did the iconic shape of the original RTB01 Space Marines develop, and how did Mike McVey create and then master the mid- 90s GW painting style? All these questions, and hundreds more, are answered in this book in the words, memories and recollections of the people who were actually there and doing these things! In addition to these incredible stories, the book is lavishly illustrated with photographs and images taken from the hundreds of the books, games, magazines and miniatures that Games Workshop has produced over the years. In addition, we have had privileged and unprecedented access to the personal collections of all the participants and present many of these artifacts and miniatures for the very first time. For anyone who has lifted their paintbrush, miniature in hand or rolled a fistful of dice across a tabletop battlefield, Talking Miniatures is an essential read. Even if you are not currently a hobbyist, Talking Miniatures will take you on a thrilling and insightful ride into that magical point where creativity and commerce coincide.},

  abstract = {Playing a dwarf, an elf, a berserker barbarian, or fighting wargs, frost giants and trolls, are among the many situations where direct or indirect references to Old Norse literature may be expressed during a game session of Dungeons and Dragons. This game is considered as one of the very first tabletop role playing games (Fine, 1983; Ewalt, 2013). This paper offers to analyse how references to Old Norse tales (sagas and Eddas) appear in productions of the cultural industries and echoes research about mythical and religious elements in contemporary games (Bainbridge, 2013). In order to show the relevance of Dungeons and Dragons as a case study to understand contemporary reception of Old Norse traditions, I will develop a cultural approach using anthropology and communication sciences (Di Filippo, 2016). In the first part, I will show how Dungeons and Dragons borrows elements from Old Norse literature among other cultural traditions. Such elements can be more or less explicit references, whether if they derive from intermediary works such as fantasy literature written by J. R. R. Tolkien (Simek, 2005), Robert E. Howard and other writers, or if they try to offer a mise en scene of medieval Scandinavia, within accessories such as Legends and Lore and Historical references — Vikings. This first section will allow to understand how the meaning and the form of traditional elements have evolved in a process that the philosopher Hans Blumenberg (1979) has called “Work on myth” (see also Di Filippo, 2016). In the second part, I will address the question of the cultural impact and influences that Dungeons and dragons has had until nowadays and how it has contributed to the spreading of Old Norse references. The famous table top role playing game indeed has a huge influence on nowadays culture: in literature, movies, TV shows, and several kinds of games : videogames, card games or other type of tabletop games (Barton, 2008). D\&D can therefore be considered as a cultural crossroad regarding Old Norse reception. Moreover, roleplayers participate in a “community of practices”, which interrogates the social dimension of this cultural phenomenon. Through those different parts, this paper offers a first insight into the multi-dimensional aspect of the reception of Old Norse traditions within roleplaying games as a cultural phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Si les rapports entre jeux et faits religieux ont assez tôt fait l’objet d’analyses dans les sciences sociales françaises, chez des auteurs comme Marcel Mauss et Émile Durkheim, cette thématique de recherche ne s’est pas développée fortement par la suite dans le champ des sciences humaines et sociales (SHS). Toutefois, depuis 2010, de nouveaux travaux abordant ces questions ont vu le jour dans le monde anglo-saxon, en prenant pour objet d’étude plus spécifiquement les jeux numériques. Après un état de l’art sur ces questions, cet article introductif propose un ensemble de pistes de réflexion pour aborder ce domaine qui connaît un renouveau d’intérêt : emprunts culturels, formes de syncrétismes, mises en scène d’éléments religieux liés aux processus de structuration, stratégies identitaires ludiques et religions, polémiques religieuses et paniques morales et, enfin, porosités des frontières entre activités ludiques et religieuses.},

  abstract = {Many psychologists, therapists, and educators have emphasized the practice of play, especially with enacted roles, as a site for learning and therapeutic growth. This article weaves together a plethora of theories from psychology, Counseling, and role-playing game studies in an effort to understand the nature of enacted roles, their relationship to identity, and their transformative potential. Challenging the notion that identity is a fixed, stable monolith, the article synthesizes four overall approaches to theorizing the nature of identity drawn from various theories: identity as a social construct, narrative identity, identity as psychodynamic, and identities as parts of a whole. The authors posit that these ways of framing identity can help role-players, designers, and facilitators better understand the multifaceted nature of selfhood. This work holds implications for understanding the enactment of characters in role-playing games, especially with regard to the transformative potential of the role-playing experience.},

  abstract = {ESPAÑOL La presente propuesta busca establecer que, por medio de la narración y la construcción de un relato colectivo, el cual acontece en un juego de rol; se gesta una (inter)subjetividad compartida entre los miembros de los juegos de rol. Esta última entendida como la estructura que permite organizar sentimientos, emociones, percepciones e ideas de los sujetos sociales, en este caso, los jugadores/narradores. Es decir, hay una estructura organizativa interior que se genera en la interacción por medio del relato durante el juego. De esta forma, el relato/juego, se vuelve un mecanismo de construcción de subjetividades que es interiorizada por los participantes al mismo tiempo que se relata la historia. Volviendo así a los participantes narradores y consumidores de su propia estructura (inter) subjetiva. La estructura se vuelve un acontecimiento que nace de la interacción entre narradores/jugadores, desde sus propias sensibilidades y que son compartidas durante el juego. No es que los jugadores terminen con la misma (inter)subjetividad, pero al menos hay rasgos característicos que comparten entre jugadores/narradores: desde valores similares, formas de jugar, entendimiento del juego, objetivos, sensaciones, percepciones e ideas. Las subjetividades se alimentan entre sí después de varias sesiones de juego. La anterior dinámica favorece a la expansión de lo que aquí se propone llamar como horizontes de interpretación de los jugadores/narradores. Es decir, los parámetros de creación de símbolos, significados y discursos, que se gestan durante la sesión de juego, dándole especificidad a cada mesa. En este sentido, cada grupo de narradores/jugadores se vuelve un acontecimiento único permitiendo espacios de emancipación de la subjetividad neoliberal, producida por la sociedad del capitalismo tardío. La ponencia se articula sobre las nociones teóricas de Gilles Deleuze, particularmente en el texto de Empirismo y subjetividad, en el cual Deleuze hace una radiografía de la filosofía de David Hume, y pone el acento en la imaginación como producción de conocimiento, estableciendo que el empirismo es el nacimiento de la subjetividad. Lo anterior será complementado con las nociones de micropolítica de Félix Guattari, Michel Foucault y Suely Rolnick como manifestaciones de las organizaciones del poder en los niveles más personales de los sujetos sociales, llegando inclusive a las mesas de juegos de rol. Ahí, la narración/juego se dirime como espacio de emancipación de la subjetividad neoliberal, aquí definida como una producción maquínica e industrial de regímenes de organizaciones internas de emociones, percepciones y sensaciones. Todo esto visto como un proceso de resignificaciones entre discursos y símbolos. Así, los juegos de rol serían espacios de resignificación y emancipación de la subjetividad neoliberal, en los cuales los narradores/jugadores pueden crear su propia (inter)subjetividad colectivamente. ENGLISH This proposal seeks to establish that, through the narration and construction of a collective story, which takes place in a role-playing game; a shared (inter)subjectivity is created among the members of the role-playing games. The latter understood as the structure that allows to organize feelings, emotions, perceptions and ideas of the social subjects, in this case, the players / narrators. That is, there is an internal organizational structure that is generated in the interaction through the story during the game. In this way, the story/game becomes a mechanism of construction of subjectivities that is internalized by the participants at the same time that the story is told. Thus returning to the participants narrators and consumers of their own (inter) subjective structure. The structure becomes an event that is born from the interaction between narrators / players, from their own sensibilities and that are shared during the game. It's not that players end up with the same (inter)subjectivity, but at least there are characteristic traits they share between players/storytellers: from similar values, ways of playing, understanding of the game, goals, sensations, perceptions and ideas. Subjectivities feed off each other after several game sessions. The above dynamic favors the expansion of what is proposed here to be called as horizons of interpretation of the players/narrators. That is, the parameters of creation of symbols, meanings and speeches, which are developed during the game session, giving specificity to each table. In this sense, each group of narrators/players becomes a unique event allowing spaces of emancipation from neoliberal subjectivity, produced by the society of late capitalism. The paper is articulated on the theoretical notions of Gilles Deleuze, particularly in the text of Empiricism and subjectivity, in which Deleuze makes an x-ray of the philosophy of David Hume, and emphasizes the imagination as a production of knowledge, establishing that empiricism is the birth of subjectivity. This will be complemented by the notions of micropolitics of Félix Guattari, Michel Foucault and Suely Rolnick as manifestations of the organizations of power at the most personal levels of social subjects, even reaching the tables of role-playing games. There, the narrative/game is directed as a space of emancipation from neoliberal subjectivity, here defined as a machinic and industrial production of regimes of internal organizations of emotions, perceptions and sensations. All this seen as a process of resignifications between discourses and symbols. Thus, role-playing games would be spaces of resignification and emancipation from neoliberal subjectivity, in which narrators/players can create their own (inter)subjectivity collectively.},

The depiction of the process in the adventure considered the milestones and obligatory actions to achieve the R\&D goal. Findings The voluntary survey was completed by 59\% (n~=~72) of participants. Over 90\% of the respondents stated that the game helped them better understand generic drug development. The RPG application allowed a narrative description of the process with the possibility of students' involvement in drug development that mixed regulatory, analytical, and technological issues. Summary The application of the RPG allowed the creation of a narrative description of the process with the possibility of involving students in complicated problematics concerning drug development that mixed regulatory, analytical, and technological aspects of this process.},

  abstract = {Using Johan Huizinga's concept of the magic circle as a context for understanding how sacred spaces reserved for play manifest within role-playing game (RPG) environments both digital and table-top, this dissertation argues that while certain elements of the magic circle are still present, the vast amount of work produced to monitor the boundaries of sacred game space stem from the intimate relationships between players. Online RPG environments are open to critique due to the seemingly wide-spread use of hostility as a gate-keeping tactic. Numerous studies and digital media scholars have examined how bullying, harassment, and bodily threats present within toxic digital gaming cultures act as a means of limiting access to participation. Because marginalized players, whether due to gender, race, or sexual identity, are often playing in gaming environments that get coded as toxic, this dissertation chooses to interrogate the ways in which some players negotiate game environments that are complicated at best and overtly hostile at worst. While the dissertation is careful to note the distinctions between online RPGs and offline table-top RPGs, the core argument made stems from the consistencies present between both: both the online and table-top groups who participated in the study use tools of intimacy both actively and passively as a means of fostering individual as well as group identity. In so doing, the use of intimacy acts as a buffer against hostile acts that would otherwise inhibit participation. But this dissertation does not just attempt to understand how players weather and negotiate hostility outside of their gaming groups. It also seeks to understand how some players are able to absorb the hostility and redirect it as a creative play-style. In this case, "playing ugly" becomes a means of performance not directed outward, but rather, inward. Taboo play, in this case, becomes a cathartic way in which players process hostility by becoming hostile. While this play-style may seem to mirror the online toxic environments that can further separate marginalized players from a larger online gaming ecology, playing ugly strives to make its members immune to the aggression-although whether that achievement is attainable is tenuous.},

The significance of video games within our everyday lives has certainly been increased and shaped by new technologies and gaming patterns, including the rise of home-based games consoles, advances in mobile telephone technology, the rise in more 'sociable' forms of gaming, and of course the advent of the Internet. This book explores the opportunities, challenges and patterns of gameplay and sociality afforded by the Internet and online gaming. Bringing together a series of original essays from both leading and emerging academics in the field of game studies, many of which employ new empirical work and innovative theoretical approaches to gaming, this book considers key issues crucial to our understanding of online gaming and associated social relations, including: patterns of play, legal and copyright issues, player production, identity construction, gamer communities, communication, patterns of social exclusion and inclusion around religion, gender and disability, and future directions in online gaming"-- "Over only a few decades, digital gaming has become a major global leisure activity that now rivals the movie and music sectors. Due to this increasingly widespread popularity, gaming has in recent years become the focus of increased academic interest and activity, but still little is know about those who play digital games. Online Gaming in Context is the first book to explicitly and comprehensively address how digital games are experienced and engaged with in the everyday lives, social networks, and consumer patterns of those who play them. In doing so, the book provides a key introduction to the study of gamers and the games they play, whilst also reflecting on the current debates and literatures surrounding the virtual world.},

This article presents a comprehensive study of the role of interplayer communication during the gaming process in digital and tabletop role-playing game formats. A series of empirical game experiments are presented and the player-based communication analyzed, with the aim of clarifying how format (media of expression) impacts on verbal communication in multiplayer games; as well as examining player communication in general. The results show distinct differences in the communication patterns between the two game formats, directly related to the limitations and requirements of the tabletop and digital media utilized, for example in the amount of “in-character” communication. Interplayer communication in both formats is highly focused on functional content, that is, oriented towards supporting practical gameplay; however, functional content has different meanings on the two platforms. These and other results are discussed in the context of format differences and in the larger context of the functions of verbal communication during the playing of multiplayer games.},

  abstract = {The introduction of interactivity to popular narratives has changed the relationships of authors and readers to those works, as well as the relations between the authors and readers themselves. In fact, the nature itself of those new texts is being put to question as they are no longer set but open; no longer the result of single minds, but that of a collaborative effort between conceptors and interactors. In this context, recreational role-playing games (e.g.: Advanced Dungeons \& Dragons) are seen as precursors to computerized interactive narrative media (i.e. such as computerized text-based adventure games, Muds, CD-Roms, hypertext narratives, etc.). After a review of various conceptions of interactivity, play is put forward as the most productive metaphor to start thinking about narrative interactivity. Different aspects of role-playing games (social, ludic, ideologic, etc.) are then introduced, after which their historical filiation with computerized interactive media will be presented. Finally, a discussion of the new ways in which power and pleasure are articulated around the open text will be initiated, where it will be shown how role-playing games can contribute to that reflection.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I attempt to broaden the focus of gaming experiences analyzed in Well-Played as well as start us on the path of developing understandings of the meaning of narrative, collaborative games. Toward this end, I have focused on a story-based, tabletop role-playing game: Fiasco, created by game designer Jason Morningstar (Morningstar, 2009). Fiasco provides us with a number of interesting and unique features that make it worth investigating in this context, and illustrates a number of potential mechanics that provide provocative instigations to the game-based learning community. In particular, I focus on the game as system in which a collaborative narrative is created by its players, as well as one in which failure is featured — not just as an acceptable outcome, but as the ideal one. As Wil Wheaton’s quote from The Fiasco Companion (Morningstar \& Segedy, 2011) indicates, the fun of “everything going wrong” is a central component of this game. I argue that Fiasco provides a distinct contrast to the forms of play that often dominate mastery-based forms of game-based learning, and implicit conceptions of failure that have been argued as being central to understanding games (Juul, 2013).},

The first part of fantasy is the human capacity to separate the qualities of things from the things in which they appear, and to imagine them in other things that do not have them. Many Dungeons Dragons campaigns treat magic as a kind of alternate science, but in fairy tales there is more to it than that. Fantasy succeeds when it transports us to an imaginary land, and we escape the grayer parts of our own for a little while.},

  abstract = {Research on the effect of tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) on creative potential and emotional creativity has been sparse. The present study aimed to examine how role-playing games influence creative potential and emotional creativity. Participants were assigned into either a treatment group (N = 19) or a control group (N = 20). After taking the Emotional Creativity Index (ECI) and Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA) as pre-tests, the treatment group played TRPGs once every week for four weeks. Upon the completion of the treatment, the participants retook the tests. The control group only took the pre-tests and post-tests and did not play any role-playing games. The results showed treatment group significantly enhance their creative potential as compared with the control group, but not on emotional creativity. The current study supports that TRPGs improve creative potential, implications and limitations are discussed.},

  abstract = {This study was a critical, archetypal, feminist ethnography and psychological inquiry into the experiences of women in tabletop role-playing gaming and its culture. Informed by performance ethnographic practice and the spirit of these games, it is written as an adventurous journey into and encounter with these experiences based on participant observation, interviews with gaming professionals, an online questionnaire of 428 gamers, and series of interviews with female gamers. Ethnographically, this study documents the history and experiences of women in the culture of gaming. It presents profiles of a diversity of female gainers and explores historically the ways that women have established themselves as members of this culture and shaped this traditionally male dominated hobby. It also examines a multiplicity of opinions about and experiences of sexism, prejudice, and discrimination of women in gaming. While demonstrating the progress in the games and their culture to become more inclusive and welcoming to women, it shows there is still far to go. It also demonstrates how, despite the possibility and creative potential for gaming and its culture to imagine completely new social worlds, the same power dynamics and social structures are recreated in the games, groups, and culture. Psychologically, the study uses archetypal, relational, and pluralistic models of the self to demonstrate the complex imaginal relationship between self and character and the notion that role-playing games can be transformational liminoid spaces. The study explored the multiplicity of three participants, through a series of interviews, one series with the player, one interacting with each participant in role as one of their characters, and then a final series reflecting on the experience of the two previous interviews, the process, and the themes that were discussed. These interviews demonstrate three different relationships between self and character, as well as the ways that those imaginal relationships have impacted the lives of these women in powerful ways that reach beyond just fun and games.},

  abstract = {This article explores the asymmetrical treatment of race and gender, critiquing the conflation of these categories under the intersectional concept of “identity.” I conducted a three-year ethnography of the “live action role play” (LARP) community to explore this asymmetry. I found that Live Action Role Players (LARPers) consciously abandoned gender roles but were deeply invested in creating racial categories to make games “feel real.” When creativity is paramount, what makes for this differential treatment? I identified key distinctions in how these categories were conceived, embodied, and enforced. I found that LARPers engaged in collective negotiations to maintain a homogenous understanding of fictional racial categories. When players deviated, they were coerced back into uniform embodiment. These categories often drew on existing racial stereotypes, using “real world flavor.” When participants attempted anti-racist interventions, conversations shifted from confronting racism to “understanding race.” Conversely, LARPers framed gender as a self-determined choice that should have no impact on the gaming experience. Gender performance was welcome but not predetermined. This led to greater gender inclusion and effective anti-sexist interventions. Accordingly, the “both/and” framing of identity—authentic self-navigating society—is an empowering model for gender as it legitimizes autonomous choice. However, when applied to race it risks obfuscating the collective practices that fortify racism. Intersectional theorists must abandon efforts to draw similarities between race and gender. Instead, intersectional research must identify the ways in which sexism and racism persist and compound. The confrontation of racecraft is a necessary first step in developing more robust solutions.},

  abstract = {North American larping (live-action roleplaying) is a collaborative performance that encourages critical and creative engagement with cooperative, improvisational narratives. Nevertheless, larping often relies on problematic engagements with race and racial stereotypes. Like many gaming hobbies, larp uses the idea of a “playable race”. Unlike other gaming arenas, however, larping necessitates that players physically embody a character in order to participate in the collaborative narrative: larpers embody fictional races and engage in a complex form of “race play”. Within this context, non-Indigenous players frequently appropriate Indigenous cultural practices and mobilize racist stereotypes. This paper explores this phenomenon and its ramifications. Based on seven years of ethnographic fieldwork and community participation in New England larping communities, I examine how concepts of Indigenous identity manifest in New England larp. I explore both Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives in order to demonstrate (a) how fantastical play facilitates cultural appropriation and damaging “race play” and (b) how these spaces affect Indigenous players. I close with Indigenous perspectives on new possibilities for Indigenous larp projects and cultural reclamation.},

  abstract = {This paper examines pleasure and combat in the context of North American East Coast boffer combat larp. Based on ethnographic research conducted in US East Coast larping communities, I investigate how live-action role-players (larpers) use larp to explore fictional violence and the experience of the imagined combatant. I demonstrate how, through collaborative play and performance, larpers explore not only the tragedy of war but the pleasures of teamwork, community, and individual self-worth. I further explore how women and underrepresented genders make spaces for themselves by challenging sexist notions of physical fitness, capacity for violence, and leadership. I show how these interactions foster networks of personal and communal pleasure that depend on a/n (re)imagining of warfare, strife, and death: combat, creativity, and collaborative play generate complex relationships between violence, community, and the imaginary world of fictionalised battle. However, within this discussion, I ultimately suggest that ‘(role)playing at war’ creates spaces of camaraderie while simultaneously normalising violence. I problematise larp violence as an activity that resists generalised definitions of violent play and pleasure.},

  abstract = {My straightforward observation of the activity of role-playing is that many participants do not enjoy it very much. Most role-players I encounter are tired, bitter, and frustrated. My goal in this writing is to provide vocabulary and perspective that enable people to articulate what they want and like out of the activity, and to understand what to look for both in other people and in game design to achieve their goals. The person who is entirely satisfied with his or her role-playing experiences is not my target audience. Everything in this document is nothing more nor less than "What Ron Thinks." It is not an official Dogma for the Forge. It is not a consensus view of members of the Forge, nor is it a committee effort of any kind. It is most especially not an expectation for what you're supposed to think or believe. However, it does stand as the single coherent body of theory about role-playing at the Forge, and its lexicon is definitive for purposes of discussion there. I am satisfied with it, but I'm not unreasonable either, so it is not immutable. Please deal with it in one of the following ways: identify an inconsistency, ask for clarification and examples, or otherwise address its content critically. I am perfectly willing to amend any content, if I'm given a substantive reason to do so, and to give credit for the insight. I request that all discussion of this material be based on careful consideration. Snap judgments, unsupported value judgments, neophobia, taking offense, and other juvenile reactions are not welcome. Furthermore, I am well aware that my GNS notions vary greatly from the original Threefold Model (or GDS), and that my categories of Stance differs from those originally proposed. Identifying these differences does not constitute a criticism. I have been extensively influenced by the work of others and have incorporated it in ways which make sense to me. Concepts that were originated and developed by others are credited in the acknowledgments at the end.},

  abstract = {Urban fantasy, the genre of fantastic literature in which magic and monsters meet modern society, is fairly young but has old roots. Stefan Ekman’s book, Urban Fantasy: Exploring Modernity through Magic, examines the genre in depth, including its inherent social commentary, its historical development, and its interplay between modernity and the fantastic. The author draws on a wide range of urban fantasy texts from five decades, combining detailed analysis of dozens of novels and other media with broad discussions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the genre across three sections. The first section presents an overview of what the genre looks like today—both in terms of its common traits and its variety of settings—and how it has developed over time, including the history of urban fantasy scholarship. The second section examines urban fantasy’s core concern with the unseen, for example through a focus on unseen individuals overlooked by society or hiding within it, and on ignored urban spaces or labyrinthine undergrounds. The third section addresses how urban fantasy explores the relationship between the supernatural and modernity. Ekman offers readings of fiction by Ben Aaronovitch, Lauren Beukes, P. Djelí Clark, Charles de Lint, Neil Gaiman, Max Gladstone, Kim Harrison, N.K. Jemisin, and Megan Lindholm, among others.Urban Fantasy will appeal to teachers and students of the fantastic as well as to urban fantasy enthusiasts and literary scholars. Ekman illuminates the genre’s evolution and defining traits, inviting readers to rethink urban fantasy as a creative tool for using magic to explore modernity.},

Applying an interdisciplinary approach, this thesis presents primary texts and historical documents of the Satanic Panic and then proceeds to address the Satanic Panic sociologically. Finally, this thesis performs ideological criticism on an anti-Dungeons \& Dragons text to demonstrate historical, sociological, and ideological trends in a major movement within conservative American Christianity, the influence of which reverberates to this day.},

  abstract = {Publié pour la première fois en 1974, Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) est considéré comme le premier jeu de rôle (JDR), marquant les débuts d’un nouveau genre de loisir. Il constitue le premier succès qui distingue immédiatement le jeu de rôle (sur table) en tant que catégorie de jeux à part entière, différente des wargames dont il est au départ une variation. Une communauté de joueurs se développe et devient rapidement très importante, ce qui incite la publication d’autres jeux de cette catégorie (Tékumel, Tunnels \& Trolls, Chivalry \& Sorcery, Traveller, Runequest...). Cinquante ans plus tard, en 2024, les jeux de rôle sont fortement présents au sein de l’offre ludique (Appelcline, 2014). D’autres communautés de joueurs se sont formées et des controverses, propres à cette pratique nouvelle touchant de nombreux adolescents, ont vu le jour (Laycock, 2015). Le domaine s’est élargi et les jeux se sont multipliés, touchant à de nombreux genres de la fiction. Les règles ont, elles aussi, évolué et offrent des expériences de jeux variées. Ainsi les jeux de rôle ont-ils fortement marqué les cultures populaires contemporaines depuis leur création, notamment les jeux vidéo dont certains sont fortement inspirés de D\&D ou d’autres jeux de rôles, ou les séries télévisées, tout en continuant à progresser et à s’adapter à de nouveaux contextes. Ainsi les JDR n’ont-ils cessé d’être pratiqués, d’évoluer et d’être édités. À l’occasion de cet anniversaire, ce colloque souhaite donc revenir sur les cinq décennies de Dungeons \& Dragons et des jeux de rôle et, plus largement, sur l’histoire de ce loisir et sur ses enjeux sociaux et culturels.},

  abstract = {ESPAÑOL Los juegos de rol existen hace ya más de 50 años; pero, su impacto y beneficios en el desarrollo del niño no son valorados y/o reconocidos. Por ese motivo, la presente investigación argumenta que los juegos de rol pueden influir en la construcción de las relaciones interpersonales en niños. Mediante el análisis teórico, se ha buscado en el capítulo 1analizar desarrollo de los juegos de rol; explicando -mediante un marco conceptual debidamente articulado- las motivaciones detrás del juego, para, luego, poder discutir la importancia y necesidad de los juegos. Este estudio concluye que los juegos de rol pueden brindar beneficios en la representación y expresión de los niños, entre otros factores. Cabe resaltar, la importancia que tiene en el desarrollo cognitivo del niño (tanto a nivel de procesos cognitivos básicos como complejos). Un dato adicional que debe ser tomado en cuenta, es que se ha podido identificar que los aportes que brindan los juegos de rol van a depender del nivel de cercanía de la relación entre un jugador y el otro. Finalmente, también se resalta la necesidad del acompañamiento y las contribuciones de adultos y pares en torno a los niños y sus ambientes de socialización (e.g. el contexto lúdico), pues cada espacio de interacción social aporta de alguna manera al desarrollo del niño, ya sea presentando nuevos caminos para resolver problemas, posibilidad de comparación de habilidades para medir competencia, entre otros. En ese sentido, es beneficioso que los padres entiendan las ventajas sociales, cognitivas y afectivas que traen los juegos, y participen en estos con sus hijos. ENGLISH Role-playing games have existed for more than 50 years; however, their impact and benefits in children's development are not valued and/or recognized. For this reason, this research argues that role-playing games can influence the construction of interpersonal relationships in children. By means of theoretical analysis, chapter 1 seeks to analyze the development of role-playing games, explaining -through a properly articulated conceptual framework- the motivations behind the game, in order to then discuss the importance and necessity of the games. This study concludes that role-playing games can provide benefits in the representation and expression of children, among other factors. It is worth highlighting its importance in children's cognitive development (both at the level of basic and complex cognitive processes). An additional fact that should be taken into account is that it has been identified that the contributions provided by role-playing games will depend on the level of closeness of the relationship between one player and the other. Finally, the need for accompaniment and the contributions of adults and peers around children and their socialization environments (e.g. the play context) is also highlighted, since each social interaction space contributes in some way to the child's development, either by presenting new ways to solve problems, the possibility of comparing skills to measure competence, among others. In this sense, it is beneficial that parents understand the social, cognitive and affective advantages that games bring, and participate in them with their children.},

The theoretical foundations for this study are the Communicated Narrative Sense-Making (CNSM) Theory (Koenig Kellas, 2018) and the concept of co-telling (Mandelbaum, 1987). For this study, 15 individuals who have played D\&D online for more than six months with friends they have met in person participated in in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify two emergent themes. The theme of styles of collaborative storytelling, which looks at the different ways that collaborative narratives are shaped in D\&D and the focus of the told narratives, provided insight the process of collaborative storytelling in online D\&D groups. The theme online collaborative storytelling as “more than,” refers to the finding that the experience of stories collaboratively told in D\&D as real, as working together, and as a commitment work together to make online D\&D feel like a more meaningful mode of CMC friendship maintenance. This study expands the research on CNSM theory and co-telling to include fictional and improvisational stories as meaningful types of collaborative storytelling that can influence relationship quality and relationship maintenance.},

However, along with this creative freedom, RPGs contain rote rules and restrictions that must be followed. This paradox creates an intrinsic tension that players are forced to deal with. Rather than casting off restrictions, or punishing players that do not submit, gamers need to understand the purpose and necessity of rules, and be empathetic towards other players when they have difficulty following the dictates of a gaming manual. If these principles are followed, then true sub-creation can take place, and players can enter fully into a secondary world.},

Released in 1974 -- decades before the Internet and social media -- Dungeons \& Dragons inspired one of the original nerd subcultures, and is still revered by millions around the world. Now the authoritative history of the game is revealed by an award-winning journalist and lifelong D\&D player. David Ewalt recounts the development of Dungeons \& Dragons from the game's roots on the battlefields of ancient Europe, through the hysteria that linked it to satanic rituals and teen suicides, to its apotheosis as father of the modern video-game industry. As he chronicles the game's surprising origins (a history largely unknown even to hardcore players) and examines D\&D's impact, Ewalt interweaves subculture analysis with his own gaming experiences to shed light on America's most popular (and widely misunderstood) form of collaborative entertainment.},

  abstract = {The role-playing game attracts a growing number of practisers. The aim of this master ́s thesis is to examine role-playing literature as phenomenon in libraries through librarians ́ attitudes. The paper is based on qualitative interviews with eight librarians: one personal interview with two librarians and six e-mail interviews with six librarians at different libraries. The paper starts with a definition of the term ”role-playing game”, its different categories and genres and a description of its background. We also discuss the debate about role-playing games and their position in society. We use Pierre Bourdieu ́s theories about habitus, capital and taste and apply them to the librarians’ attitude towards users  and literature. We place role-playing literature at the same level as popular literature. We describe the history of popular  literature and the criticism against it and focus on fantasy literature. The scientific aspect of popular literature, in which we place role-play literature as well, has become more acceptable during the latest decades. The result of this paper shows that the librarians have a positive attitude towards role-playing literature at libraries and they feel that it can stimulate  creativity and traditional reading as well as own writing.  It can also attract people who don’t visit libraries regularly. The future of role-playing literature depends on the librarians’  willingness to familiarize themselves with the benefits and drawbacks of role-playing games and also how they market  the games to their colleagues and the market of users.},

  abstract = {This paper tries to solve the problem where automated character creation for Tabletop RPGs is completely random and does not fully pleases certain players, especially those that have difficulty in being creative and adapting characters to their personal tastes. To accomplish that, the usage of a Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was proposed, in conjunction with the user's input (positive or negative) during generations, to create characters focused on having traits that are catered to each individual's taste. The generated traits are "Race", "Class", "Size", "Visual Trait", "Personality" and "Quirk". The fitness calculation for each individual was made using trait tables with weights previously defined by the programmer, and posteriorly by the user's evaluation of the characters during execution. The project was made using the Unity game engine with C\# language, to take advantage of the tool's easy interface creation. It was produced as a phone application, for ease of distribution and general use. The application was tested with a variety of users, and the results, presented in the form of graphs, indicate that the rejection rate was almost null, with the great majority of users recognizing the gradual improvement of suggestions between generations, and evaluating positively the characters generated by the algorithm.},

This study aims to identify nurses preparedness in rural area community health centers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malang for self-control to implement health protocol. This study intends to provide insights on controlling COVID-19 spread in Malang, Indonesia. This research is a quantitative study with correlative analytic observational design and a cross-sectional approach involving 120 nurses from 16 primary health centers. The results of the bivariate analysis using gamma correlation test are: knowledge factors (p=0.005; r=0.35), attitude (p=0.000; r=0.46), means of infrastructure (p=0.000; r=0.54), and self-control (p=0.000; r=0.52) for the quarantined COVID-19 patients. Knowledge, attitude, infrastructure, and safe house factors can influence self-control for COVID-19. In rural areas, health education—as education and empowerment for patient self-control—is an effort to encourage them to obey health protocol during the pandemic. Nurse readiness and preparedness during the pandemic is crucial for strengthening the assertive behavior commitment through self-control. This ensures the community's awareness of the importance of complying with health protocols for the common good. Mental nursing intervention needs to be added as a part of psychosocial therapy for the community's social problems, primarily in reducing the pressure due to the social distancing enforcement to control and prevent COVID-19 spread.},

Much of the research on autism has been conducted in laboratories with individual research participants or in contexts where people on the autism spectrum represent a small and problematized minority among nonautistic people—trends that risk essentializing the stereotype of people with autism as fundamentally estranged from sociality, by nature at odd angles with shared culture. The book takes a different approach: It is based on ethnographic fieldwork in communities where people on the autism spectrum come together. Such spaces tend to assemble people who are affected by autism in a variety of ways: people who have the diagnosis, people who have interests in common with people who have the diagnosis, family members, professionals who have chosen to dedicate much of their professional lives to autism, and others as well. The book chronicles the ways in which youth on the autism spectrum make sense of life under the description of autism. It explores the origins and implications of this paradox: How does such an irreducibly social, cultural, and interpersonal phenomenon as autism come to connote the absence of sociality, relationality, and interpersonal significance? What kind of cultural meaning-work gets done through this transformation? In doing so, the book also explores the ground on which much of this work takes place: the contested terrain of the human brain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Every summer, a group of role-playing gamers gathers in an American town. Dressed up as moon goddesses, mad scientists, and other fantastical characters, they act out elaborate, improvised narratives of transformation, destruction, and redemption. For several summers, this group, who I call the Journeyfolk, ran a camp for teenagers on the autism spectrum, engaging campers in therapeutic reconfigurations of self and social role. Through this folk healing practice, the meaning of autism was itself transformed; what had been a source of isolation became a source of commonality and community. This paper takes the camp as a case study for examining the co-productive relationship between culture and neurodiversity. Cognitive tendencies often found in autism are often thought to preclude socio-cultural participation. However, such tendencies can also facilitate the co-creation of innovative cultural spaces, through processes of affinity and affiliation. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at the camp, I identify three sites of congruity between the culture of the camp and the cognitive and phenomenological experiences associated with autism, at which this “work of culture” (Obeysekere in The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1990) took place: the structure of social interactions within roleplaying games, the narratives enacted within these games, and the interpersonal relationships within which the games were embedded.},

  abstract = {This article examines the creation of queer rhetoric through role-play to find the reparative value that Dungeons \&amp; Dragons (1974-) can potentially provide the queer communities. My work focuses on the concept of reparative play, an adaptation of reparative reading which was first proposed by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in 1995 (Sedgwick 2003). Reparative reading explores alternatives to heteronormative ideals through the act of reading. Instead of getting caught up in the problematic implications of a text, the alternatives are foregrounded (Sedgwick 2003, 137). Reparative play then expands reparative reading into the realm of play, where one explores the possibility for a sustainable queer livelihood through play (Vist 2018). I conclude with an observation of safety tools designed for tabletop RPGs, that enable reparative play.This work will be posited alongside an autoethnographic reflection of my own role-play experience as a means of demonstrating reparative play in practice. My work is founded on Sedgwick’s (2003) Touching Feeling, Kara Stone’s (2018) “Time and Reparative Game Design,” and Sarah Lynne Bowman’s (2010) The Functions of Role-Playing Games. These scholars observe role-play as a method of queer performativity and identity exploration. I propose that through the embodiment of a D\&amp;D character, set in a more accepting world, the players can enact reparative play to give an accurate and positive representation of themselves while promoting alternatives to heteronormative culture.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen debate about whether depictions of inherently evil monster races such as orcs in role playing games or literature/movies such as Lord of the Rings could be considered racist. Although such decisions may be subjective, little data has been produced to inform the debate regarding how critical an issue this is. In particular, does consuming such material relate to racism in the real world, or do a majority of individuals, particularly people of color, consider such depictions racist? The current study sought to address these issues in a sample of 308 adults (38.2\% non-White) a subset of whom (17\%) were players of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. Playing Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) was not associated with greater ethnocentrism (one facet of racism) attitudes. Only 10.2\% found a depiction of orc monsters as inherently evil to be offensive. However, when later asked the blunter question of whether the same depiction was racist, the number jumped to 34.0\%, with women particularly inclined to endorse this position. This suggests asking people about racism may prime them to see racism in material they hadn’t previously found to be offensive. Neither participant race nor history playing the D\&D game was associated with perceptions of offensiveness or racism.},

  abstract = {Orcs are monsters with origins in Irish folklore popularized in the Lord of the Rings book and movie series, and also widely used in the Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) game systems. In recent years, controversies have arisen regarding whether orcs involve racist depictions or may promote racism in real life. Recent evidence from other studies finds that playing D\&D is not associated with real-life racism, and most people including people of color don’t find depictions of orcs to be offensive or racist. However, it may still be possible that racist stereotypes are used in visual depictions of orcs. The current study sought to address this with a content analysis of 78 images of orcs from the D\&D game or from the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies from the 1970s and 2000s. Use of racist stereotypes were very rare in visual depictions of orcs and incidental when they did occur. Evidence did not support that visual depictions of orcs depended upon visual stereotypes of real-life human groups.},

  abstract = {In the following work, role-playing games will be analyzed as a space for subversion of the dominant rules to create identities, as well as a strategy to address the theoretical- discursive problems of performativity (Butler, 2002). The main axis for this topic, in addition to Judith Butler\&\#39;s concept of performativity, will be cyborg corporalities proposed by Donna Haraway (1983): the Monsterhearts role-playing system (Alder, 2019) invites us to build from discourse (It will be affirmed that every role-playing game is a groupal discursive practice, consensual and framed in a playful perspective) norm-abject corporalities. The player puts himself in the skin of a monster, a challenge to the dichotomy of nature and culture as well as a proposal to build subjective relationships with something or someone defined as “not real, not normative.” Thus, role-playing games are an invitation to explore the gender problem in terms of open discursive performativity, and to experience the “fantasy” of being able to (and having to) constitute oneself as abject corporalities. This game system is explicitly committed to revising political categories of subject, and invites players to accept the appeal of a non-normative, non-definitive character, within the framework of ludic pleasure, where gender and sexuality are established as a not answered question (Scott, 2008), and if it is answered, it is only partially and through a groupal narrative that never stops intervening with new challenges to the character.},

Additionally, this research sought to determine whether these discovered gratifications overlapped at all with perceived similar media, specifically massive multiplayer online roleplaying games, MMORPGs, and social media. A series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews designed to elicit relevant responses were conducted with 14 respondents, followed by a thematic analysis to determine gratifications. The qualitative analysis determined a set of 24 gratifications, each categorized under social, immersion, narrative, and achievement labels. Among these included potentially unique gratifications such as story creation, control, creativity, freedom, and identity exploration. Moreover, while many similar gratifications were determined for D\&D and MMORPGs, very few overlapping gratifications emerged between D\&D and social media, possibly due to the latter's lack of available immersion gratifications. This research provides an insight as to why audience members choose to actively engage with a form of entertainment media previously discounted in scholarly literature, and how these reasons to engage differ from more modern, similar available media types.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This dissertation investigated ways of promoting narrative in education within the scenario Tormenta RPG, by recognizing imaginary worlds in games as paracosms (MACKEITH), that is, as parallel models of reality, composed of immaterial heritage of humankind. The objective of this research was to reflect on imagination and freedom in processes of narrative authorship in the phenomenon Tormenta seeking to contribute to literacy practices in current education. Based on the assumption that contemporary imagination is parodic, constantly reproducing itself through language games (KEARNEY), this dissertation suggests that fostering ?dynamic imagination? (BACHELARD) could consist of a meaninful path for education, which involves freedom to recreate and reorganize symbols. Such dimension presupposes Literacy as a process of awareness by means of reading and writing. In order to achieve the general purpose, this investigation inferred that RPG (role playing games) produce hypertextual narratives ? texts formed by blocks (LEÃO) and interchanges of literary works among themselves (GENETTE) ? which could be recognized as multiliteracies. This research is, therefore, qualitative, inspired by a phenomenological approach. This study was based on the cycle of pedagogy of multiliteracies (COPE, KALANTZIS), an approach that involves experiencing, conceptualizing and analyzing narrative production in games. Processes of creation of fantasy fiction were experienced and reported in a field diary, besides observing the phenomena in social networks. In addition to Tormenta, the dissertation corpus consisted of a group of hypertextual narratives, produced as fantastic sagas, and of content published in the magazines and podcasts Dragão Brasil (2016-2020). Through an immersion in Tormenta, a comprehensive description of scenery production was conducted followed by a theoretical analysis of its imaginative dimensions, highlighting its potential for developing a liberating education. Moreover, this reflection relied on the critical approach to literacy studies, outlining challenges to the application of those games in education. It was remarkable a constant transit among the imaginary of different media and games, which broadens the understanding of artifacts, characters and scenes, pays tribute to personal myths and eases immersion in narratives, making up imaginary games as a result. According to this investigation, images in contemporary narrative productions derive from the various cultural repertoires of its creators, who ?recycle? images and seek to transform current culture during game performance. Therefore, when RPG is brought to education, it should be redesigned aiming at exploring possible otherness emerged from role play and making gamers put themselves in other?s shoes.},

A speech recognition system is used to transcribe players' speeches to text and a supervised learning algorithm detects when scene transitions take place. In its current version, a scene transition occurs whenever the emotional state of the narrative changes. Moreover, the background music is not generated, but selected based on its emotion from a library of hand-authored pieces. As future work, we plan to generate the background music considering the current scene context and the probability of scene transition. We also consider to retrieve more information from the narrative to detect scene transitions, such as the scene's location and time of the day as well as actions taken by characters.},

  abstract = {As the longevity and success of this journal attest, simulation games have had a considerable impact on the scholarly community, spawning cottage industries and academic specialties. Simulation gaming is now well established as a legitimate academic pursuit and teaching tool. Simultaneous with the growth of educational games, the 1970s witnessed the development and popularity of other role-playing games, essentially simulations, which have enjoyment and fantasy as their major goals.  These games are known generically as fantasy role-playing games. My intent in this article is to describe the games, discuss the relationship of these games to similar activities (including educational simulations), describe the players, and examine their reasons for participating in this social world. By studying these play forms, researchers who specialize in educational simulations can observe parallels in this leisure activity.},

  abstract = {Argues that humor in social interaction plays an important role in shaping identities and in structuring situational definitions. Three features of jocular interaction are of particular relevance for understanding humor's position in communication: (1) Humorous interaction demands an immediate response from its listeners. (2) Humorous interaction typically allows its animator considerable role distance, so that the implications of a jocular remark can be denied. (3) Humorous interaction as a metaphorical construction contains dense layers of meaning, and these meanings give it a significance beyond its denotative import. These 3 components permit an examination of how social actors strategically employ humor in natural interaction to altercast others (and define themselves) and to redefine situations. This analysis is illustrated by data from a gossip session among 3 teenage females and data from a participant observation study of fantasy game players. It is concluded that the realization of humor as a technique by which identities and situations are negotiated shows that this topic is of primary interest to students of social interaction.

Drawing on the resource mobilization approach to social movements, I outline a theoretical approach, labeled Provisioning Theory, which attempts to explain how leisure organizations use resources to attract and retain participants. Organizations must mobilize “fun” for members if they are to continue over time and the leisure activity is to increase in popularity. After describing how Provisioning Theory applies to a voluntary subculture (mushroom collecting), I examine two special cases of the provisioning of resources: games that are “owned” or controlled by a corporation (Dungeons \& Dragons) and voluntary sports activities organized with multiple levels of authority (Little League baseball).},

  abstract = {Gary Alan Fine analyse l’influence de la disponibilité de ressources collectives sur l’organisation d’activités de loisir. Il distingue trois principaux types de ressources : les connaissances, la sociabilité et les symboles identitaires. Ces ressources apparemment intangibles peuvent toutefois comprendre une dimension matérielle, comme l’accès à des lieux de pratique ou de réunion, des moyens de financement et de communication, ou la possibilité pour les membres de coordonner leur présence physique. Les organisations utilisent cette dimension matérielle pour contrôler l’accès aux ressources. Pour appréhender les modes d’organisation de loisirs sous cet angle, Fine mobilise trois enquêtes ethnographiques : sur Donjons et Dragons, l’un des premiers jeux de rôle commerciaux créé dans les années 1970; sur les championnats de baseball de la Little League; et sur les cueilleurs de champignons engagés dans des associations. Selon Fine, pour qu’un loisir puisse être apprécié, il est nécessaire que des ressources soient mises à disposition afin que chaque membre ait les moyens de tirer satisfaction de son engagement volontaire. Pour se démarquer de l’étude des motivations des participants, privilégiées par la psychologie sociale, Fine souligne le rôle de ressources matérielles dans les conduites étudiées. Le cas du jeu de rôle Donjons et Dragons illustre un format différent des deux autres : celui de l’organisation commerciale. Cette organisation engendre des «sous-cultures propriétaires» (Dayan, 1986), c’est-à-dire des pratiques de loisir fortement contraintes par les ressources commerciales mises à disposition des participants (manuels de règles officielles, supports de jeu, etc.). L’imposition de ressources commerciales dont l’usage est contraint par des licences légales contrôlées par l’entreprise instaure un rapport de pouvoir asymétrique en défaveur des usagers, freinant l’accès aux ressources.

  abstract = {Gary Alan FINE gehört weltweit zu den prominentesten Persönlichkeiten der zeitgenössischen soziologischen Ethnografie. In diesem Gespräch spricht er über Einflüsse in seiner akademischen Laufbahn und prägende intellektuelle Entscheidungen. Er gilt als "serieller Ethnograf", der in zahlreichen Feldkontexten gearbeitet hat und dabei einerseits Kleingruppen und eine von Menschen bevölkerte Ethnografie favorisiert, sich andererseits mit Gerüchten, Klatsch und moralischen Geschichten beschäftigt, die in kleinen und größeren Publiken erzählt werden. FINE beschreibt sein theoretisches Kerninteresse als die Untersuchung des Wechselspiels von Struktur, Interaktion und Kultur. In seinem Werk analysiert er die vielfältigen ortsgebundenen Arten und Weisen, in denen Gesellschaft von Menschen in formellen und informellen sozialen Settings verwirklicht wird, angefangen bei Baseballteams über Restaurantküchen oder die Wetterberichterstattung bis hin zum Schachspielen –um nur einige wenige Gegenstände seiner Forschungen zu nennen. Wesentlich beeinflusst durch symbolisch-interaktionistisches Denken und im Rekurs auf weitere wichtige Perspektiven auf soziale Welten plädiert er für eine selbstbewusste Haltung der ethnografischen Forschung und des ethnografischen Schreibens sowie für die Bedeutung der Konzeptarbeit in einer theorie-informierten empirischen Soziologie dessen, was Menschen zusammen tun. Autre résumé: Gary Alan FINE is among the most prominent figures in contemporary sociological ethnography worldwide. In this conversation, he talks about influences in his academic career and key intellectual choices. Considered to be a "serial ethnographer" who has worked in multiple settings, his work focuses on small groups and peopled ethnography, as well as on rumors, gossip, and moral story telling in tiny and larger publics. FINE describes his core theoretical interest as residing in the interplay of structure, interaction, and culture and discusses the multiple local ways society is realized by people in formal and informal social settings: ranging from baseball teams, restaurant kitchens, weather reporting to chess players—to name but a few research sites. Influenced by symbolic interactionist thinking and other important approaches to social worlds, he argues for a confident voice of ethnographic research and writing as well as the importance of conceptual work in a theory-informed empirical sociology of what people do together.},

Two moral panics involving children’s entertainment media—the “Satanic Panic” of the 1980s and the news media’s reaction to the Columbine High School shooting in 1999—solidified the public image of the gamer as a White male who was vulnerable to suggestions of violence or self-harm in games. Historically, White men and boys were the assumed audience for TRPGs. This dissertation puts the lived experiences of women and nonbinary gamers from several generations into historical context.

  abstract = {Das Gestalten fiktiver Welten ist ein Leitmotiv des Phantastischen. Mit dem "clash of realities" als gattungsdefinitorischem Merkmal nimmt die spezifische Weise, in der diese Bereiche inszeniert werden, und deren qualitative Bestimmung einen bedeutenden Raum in der Theorie des Phantastischen ein. Dieses zeigt sich darin zugleich auch als ein ästhetisches Paradigma, das nicht gattungs- oder gar mediengebunden ist, sondern seine spezifische Ausprägung in Abhängigkeit von dem Kontext erhält, innerhalb dessen es in Erscheinung tritt. Im Fall des phantastischen Rollenspiels wird das Überschreiten der Grenze zu diesen andren Welten zum Leitmotiv – als Raum, der nicht im Sinne z.B. einer ausgeschriebenen Text- oder Filmwelt fixiert ist, ermöglicht dieses Medium wie kein anderes die Entgrenzung der phantastischen Welt, die es in sich entwirft. Die dergestalt "grenzenlos" werdende Phantastik, der grenzenlos werdende PhantasieRaum bedingt einerseits ein schier unüberschaubares Ausmaß an Erscheinungsformen, andererseits aber auch die Problematik des Flüchtigen, Nicht-Fassbaren, das zwischen Spielwelt und physischer Realität changiert. Im Folgenden soll es um die Bestimmung dieses spezifischen Phantasie-Raumes gehen. Mit Blick auf die strukturellen Bedingungen des Mediums Rollenspiel wie seines Themas, des Phantastischen, stellen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Fragen. Erstens: Auf welche Weise eröffnet das Medium Rollenspiel seinen Raum? Und zweitens: Um was für einen Raum handelt es sich dabei?},

BADD was a group consisted of parents, teachers, and clergy who were worried about the spiritual and mental development of children, who they saw were at risk of being corrupted by a single game—Dungeons \& Dragons. The group campaigned again and again, warning fellow parents about the detrimental effect that this game could have on a child’s life. They believed Dungeons \& Dragons had a kind of power over its players—a power that could create meaning and even take children to their eternal doom. This is just one argument for the idea that tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons \& Dragons have the power to create meaning in a person’s life and influence their development. However, BADD was misinformed on how this meaning was created and how an individual’s development can be impacted by these games},

  abstract = {Role-playing games (RPGs) have revolutionized the gaming industry, fundamentally altering the way we engage with and perceive games. RPGs are defined by their emphasis on narrative-driven gameplay, character development, and immersive worlds. Originating from tabletop games like Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D), RPGs have evolved into complex digital experiences that allow players to interact with richly detailed virtual environments and storylines. This genre's growth has been propelled by advances in technology, expanding from simple text-based adventures to fully realized 3D worlds. Overall, role-playing games have significantly influenced the gaming landscape and transformed our perceptions of games as interactive experiences by advancing narrative complexity, enhancing player agency, and fostering immersive worlds.},

  abstract = {Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TRPG) which offers playersthe chance to create and inhabit a fantastical hero in an equally fantastical world, creating ashared experience with their other players and the Game Master (GM) who facilitates play.Much research has examined D\&D as an artifact, highlighting its problematic aspects and thepotential of the worlds and rules it presents as reinforcing real world hegemony orshortcoming such as male domination and racism. While building upon these ideas, thisresearch explores how players’ experiences in D\&D interact with notions of heroism, how thegame presents what it means to be a hero and how it truly is experienced within my longtimeD\&D playgroup. It does this through semi-structured interviews, to examine how the playersexperience the game, including my own reflections and input as GM for this group for anextended period of time. It utilizes the concepts of coloniality and hegemonic masculinity asframes for understanding the mechanics and narratives of D\&D and how they interact withconceptualisations of heroism. Through thematic analysis of the interview data, it highlightswhere the players' experiences line up with conceptualisations of coloniality and hegemonicmasculinity, yet also highlights where players' experiences break with or undermine theseconcepts, highlighting alternatives that move away from colonial and masculine heroism.Ultimately determining that while these players understand heroism in D\&D in ways whichreinforce or echo coloniality and hegemonic masculinity such as imperial violence, theiractual experiences with heroism are often removed from this, focusing more on collaborationand problem solving devoid of violence.},

  abstract = {This researcher asks the question as to how an individual's identity development is affected by playing the game Dungeons \& Dragons and similar tabletop roleplaying games, as well as asks ancillary questions related to questions of the interplay between the Characters participants create in game and their out of game persona’s, Escapism, the role of gender as well as the nature of reality, all within the context of the game Dungeons \& Dragons. The researcher conducted a series of 8 interviews with participants whom he plays the game with in a number of organized game sessions both before and during the course of this research. The Researcher finds that effects to one's identity do not extend to the participants personalities, but are mainly focused on their behavioral and emotional development. The researcher also found that there was a spectrum of different types of characters created by players, ranging from those that were reflections or embodiments of certain aspects of their personality to create new identities or those who create completely new identities, much in line with research conducted by Sherry Turkle on this topic. The researcher also finds that the game can act as a means of gender empowerment should the participant take part in a game group that is encouraging in that manner. The researcher concludes by stating that while all effects to one's identity through playing Dungeons \& Dragons would be dependant on a myriad of factors related to the game sessions that player participates in, noting that positive influences can be elicited through gameplay dependant on the nature of the game group. All in all the researcher notes that there is a myriad of avenues for further research within this topic.},

  abstract = {To better understand the phenomenon that is Critical Role, and to unravel how it and similar live-streamed RPGs have evolved as a form of entertainment media intended not just for players, but for an audience, I looked at several factors, including the nature of TTRPGs as collaborative storytelling and the relationship of live-streamed gameplay to other forms of entertainment, such as improv shows, sports broadcasts, and reality television. When examined all together, it becomes clear that there is something more to this entertainment medium than simply watching people play a game, and that the appeal of Critical Role and other live-streamed TTRPG programs owes much to the medium’s ability to leverage the effect of narrative transportation—that feeling of being drawn into a narrative through imagination and empathy for the characters—as well as the intensely collaborative nature of this form of storytelling, which requires participants to make and commit to highly consequential story-changing decisions on the fly. The willingness of players to commit to the “yes, and” of improv transforms the role-playing game into a powerful vehicle for collaborative storytelling, while the unpredictability of real-time dice rolls combined with the inversion of traditional pacing (such that fights that would take only seconds in reality play out over the course of hours) keep viewers and players alike on the edge of their seats for hours at a time, wondering what will happen next.},

Inicialmente trazidos ao Brasil por meio de jogadores que os adquiriram no exterior e os compartilharam por meio de fotocópias em xérox com suas comunidades, livros e revistas de RPG gradualmente atraíram o interesse de editoras nacionais, que passaram a publicá-los em edições traduzidas ou em versões originais, competindo por um lugar nesse mercado até meados dos anos 1990, período em que se dá o predomínio das editoras paulistas Devir e Trama. Partindo do princípio que o livro é central nesse gênero de jogos, utilizamos como aporte teórico e metodológico aqueles utilizados por historiadores do livro e da leitura, com a finalidade de compreender o processo pelo qual os livros de regras e os chamados suplementos de RPG instauraram-se em meio ao mercado editorial paulista, popularizando-se e expandindo-se em meio a eventos e comunidades locais de jogadores. Para compreender também, mais especificamente, questões voltadas à leitura e à apropriação e ressignificação dos jogos de RPG, vindos dos EUA ao Brasil, foram pesquisadas diversas edições da maior revista nacional especializada nestes jogos, a Dragão Brasil, analisando sua seção de cartas de leitores e alguns de seus conteúdos e ilustrações. Dessa maneira, procuramos apresentar as linhas gerais do que foi esse mercado, a partir do caso de São Paulo, nesses anos iniciais, e apontar elementos sobre como o gênero dos livros de RPG, em um primeiro momento, de forma americana, foi recriado no Brasil no período exposto.},

This research is going to be focused on the hypothesis that role playing in a tabletop role-playing game, as opposed to doing a watercolor social, will increase the frequency of using ToM abilities the next day. Participants will be 40 adult students at Minnesota State University, Moorhead, and will take a researcher-developed ToM Frequency Scale regarding a social interaction they had that day before and after their assigned event. The participants will be split evenly between two events, one being an activity where people socialize and make abstract watercolor paintings, and the other will be a tabletop role-playing game.},

  abstract = {The most recent edition of tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) has gained much popularity. This is often contributed to the presence of D\&D in popular media and of players live-streaming their D\&D game online. This form of live-streaming has also garnered popularity online. D\&D publisher Wizards of the Coast has also started their own official D\&D streaming channel on the platform Twitch. This paper examines the relationship between these official streams and the game itself through the lenses of paratext and transmedia. This allows insight into how these streams extend the game into a new medium and illustrates how these streams can influence the perceptions of the viewer on the game. These aspects in the streams will be examined in order to argue that Wizards of the Coast’s move to regularly live-stream Dungeons and Dragons sessions compliments the transmedia aspect of Dungeons and Dragons as a franchise.},

We are looking for along this assignment to understand the structure of the RPG games and to describe possible situations of lecture that comes out from the game. To analyse and to make clear the teenagers written in the RPG context and to map the preparatory lectures for the achievement of the games. The research is qualitative, ethnography and searches the understanding of the object from direct observation and the analysis of the unique productions from a group of subjects that participate in socio cultural contexts linked to the use of RPG. Our methodology consists in the observation in situations of the game, interview with a group of six young players of RPG, and the analysis of the written production by this young players and the documentary research of the game handbook. Among the mainly theorical references, we used Roger Chartin (1998) which contributes for a better view of the changes in the use of the written, Carla viana Coscarelly (2005) Else Martins Dos Santos (2005) e Luciana Zenha Cordeiro (2001) that allows to understand the social manners, from school and not from school and the interferences in the way of lectures and written which comes from the presence of new technologies. Maria da Graça Costa Val (2004) that offers an instrumental theory to analyse the textual characterists presents in the written productions of the teenagers and Sonia Rodrigues (2005) pioneer in the RPG studies in Brazil. The results indicate that the RPG games presents as a large and diverse field for production of oral and written narratives. The teenagers find many reasons to produce written through literary lectures of RPG and from this lectures produce unique texts under the written way such as individual or collective form. The universe of these teenagers lectures is large, diverse and the motive to these practices of lecture. Mainly those which purpose is the preparation for the game. Finally the written that comes from RPG according to the teenagers, contribute for the expansion of their socio relationships.},

  abstract = {While the queering of Fantasy is not a recent project, the convergence of social justice discourse with critical analysis within various fandom spaces in the twenty-first century has encouraged a renewed focus on LGBTQIA+ representation amongst writers, readers, and fans. The comic book series DIE (2019-2021) by Kieron Gillen, Stephanie Hans, and Clayton Cowles is a queer negotiation of Fantasy genre culture, represented here through the microcosm of a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG). Through the journey of the genderfluid protagonist Ash, Gillen implies that queer voices are one means of ‘saving' the Fantasy genre - however, the queer subject must first understand and celebrate their own authority. This article examines DIE’s use of the TTRPG to encapsulate a snapshot of contemporary Fantasy genre culture, before exploring how and why the queer subject is treated as newly empowered within this imaginative ecosystem. Gillen utilises TTRPGs’ capacity as a metatext to comment on Fantasy’s history, traditions, and contemporary climate, and positions Die itself as a ‘grimdark’ setting, treating this subgenre as the epitome of the trends of hypermasculinity within Fantasy’s canon. The comics then explore Ash’s struggle against the self-imposed limitations that result from existing as boundlessly queer within a subculture working to limit them. It is only through Ash’s disruptive manipulation of desire, and acceptance of themselves, that they can progress in DIE’s final quest, take on the mantle of hero and author, and save the world that stands for Fantasy itself. TTRPGs are therefore shown to not simply enshrine Fantasy’s legacy, rather they enable players to also respond to it transformatively. Alongside the context of Ash’s queer subjectivity, DIE implies that a generative future of Fantasy lies with these newly empowered creators, who grapple with the genre’s conservative traditions and remake them anew.},

  abstract = {Musical compositions that utilise game-like qualities and mechanics are commonly often referred to as “game pieces”. The history of the game piece spans across a long history, including “parlour games” of the Classical era, children’s games, and experimental Surrealist games of the early twentieth century. Ever since the emergence of Postmodernism, the boundaries of what a game piece can artistically achieve have greatly expanded, thanks to the work of composers such as Iannis Xenakis, Pauline Oliveros, John Zorn, Jennifer Walshe, and James Saunders. Following in their stead, this thesis offers a new and novel framework for considering and creating game pieces, specifically through the lens of the design of tabletop roleplaying games, a genre of improvisational character-based game which includes Dungeons and Dragons and Cyberpunk 2020, amongst others. To show that this approach is not only novel but substantial, the author has written three new experimental game pieces to explore specific ideas and recurring themes present in a variety of tabletop roleplaying games, from worldbuilding, ritual, the unique relationship between the “Game Master” and the players, character creation, and roleplay. This framework not only lends itself to interesting and underexplored ideas within modern composition, but can also be used as a site for further experimentation of game pieces within the future.},

  abstract = {Loisir de niche, le jeu de rôle grandeur nature ou « larp » a été relativement peu étudié par la recherche en sciences de l'éducation. Ce jeu de société a pour spécificité intéressante d’impliquer le corps dans une activité intercréative et théâtrale (Caïra, 2007 ; Kapp, 2013 ; David, 2015, 2016 ; Harviainen et al., 2018). L'étude des processus de participation individuelle et sociale qui ont lieu avant, pendant et après un larp peut nous aider à en comprendre les processus d'apprentissage dans une situation d’apprentissage informelle (Schugurensky, 2007 ; Brougère, 2009, 2016). Nous basons notre analyse sur une participation-observante auto-ethnographique, complétée par des entretiens avec des joueur·euses et des concepteur·trices du larp Legion (Rolling, 2016). Celui-ci est organisé comme une marche hivernale en République Tchèque pour vivre un récit historique tchèque et constitue par sa corporalité un exemple facilement différentiable du jeu de société ou du jeu de rôle dit « sur table ». Notre analyse nous amène à comprendre comment le dispositif encourage l’apprentissage auto-dirigé pour « mieux » participer aux mécanismes ludiques et théâtraux proposés, et favorise la constitution de communautés éphémères de pratiques (Lave, Wenger, 1991 ; Wenger, 2005 ; Berry, 2008) dont les échanges et le débriefing contribuent à des apprentissages sociaux, émotionnels et cognitifs. La méthodologie utilisée ouvre la voie à des associations possibles entre pratiques de recherche et pratiques de jeu de rôle en larp.},

  abstract = {Michael Freudendhal présente son mémoire sur le jeu de rôle grandeur nature ou « larp~» Legion: a Siberian Story (Rolling, 2014) qui s’inspire d’un fait historique lié à la création de la première République Tchèquoslovaque en 1918 : la marche à travers une Sibérie en pleine guerre civile par une troupe militaire de l’armée russe, majoritairement composée de Tchèques et de Slovaques.Si Legion est présenté comme une expérience physiquement exigeante avec de grands efforts pour donner une impression d’authenticité historique, il a été également conçu par l’association pour se réapproprier et transmettre une histoire nationale. Bien que l’association se présente comme développant des jeux éducatifs, Legion n’est pas présenté comme tel.~Il paraît donc intéressant d’interroger la relation entre les formes de participation et la recherche d’authenticité historique de Legion.Le chercheur s'intéresse d’une part aux cadres de l’expérience, souvent mobilisés pour analyser le jeu de rôle (Fine, 1983 ; Caïra, 2007 ; Kapp, 2013 ; Stenros, 2015 ; Kamm, 2020) puisque dans ce contexte interculturel, respecter le cadre diégétique revient à respecter la culture locale. D’autre part, il fait appel au modèle MÉDIAL (Caïra, 2018) qui distingue plusieurs dimensions de l’engagement ludique. Dans le cas de Legion, l’engagement dans la Diégèse ou l’Intrigue porte à la fois sur la narration proposée dans le dispositif et à la fois sur les origines documentaires de cette narration.},

  abstract = {While much effort has gone into the systematic study of conduction and socio-cultural analysis of role-playing, little focus has been directed towards the actual role-playing experience, and what human faculties make such fanciful and rather extraordinary abstractions possible. In the existing literature such terms as “immersion” and “diegetic space” fly about, almost taking a life of their own, but no one seems to direct too much interest towards how they are achieved by the human mind. In some respects, this lack of immediate interest is no wonder, since the ability to picture and act out imagined scenarios is such an integrated part of everyday life; even though it might be one of the truly wonderful and unique aspects of being human. The paper shows what human abilities are involved in the creation of roleplaying experience, how immersion is achieved in terms of representation, and what tried and tested terms can be borrowed from cognitive science to explain these more “airy” aspects of the phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Purpose of the study is to identify markers, "risk zones" that contribute to deviations among representatives of the subculture "roleviks", to elaborate a technology to correct negative experiences among "role" movement representatives to increase the efficiency of their adaptation. The following research methods were used in this study: “Questionnaire of the hierarchical structure of actual personal fears” (ISAS) methodology to identify phobias; Personality Belief Questionnaire – PBQ to specify dysfunctional beliefs impeding adaptation (emotional well-being, constructive relationships with other people, etc.). The research results suggest that a systematic integrated approach is a necessary condition for the success of the psychological technology aimed at overcoming negative experiences and maladaptation of "role" movement subculture representatives. A combination of diagnostic and correctional models to overcome social fears, deprivation and maladaptation makes up the essence of the technology. The research provides findings that can be used by managers of various levels in the education system, social workers, teachers and practical psychologists in the education system; they can also be of use while organizing special programs for educators, social and psychological services. It has been worked out to help students - “roleviks” to overcome their social fears. It represents a system of single interrelated activities determined to form and develop personal adaptive resources. It has been established that positive changes in adaptation strategies, a decrease in the level of social fears and anxiety are the main criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the presented psychological-pedagogical technology. It is shown that the applied technology promotes the decrease of experienced fears intensity, forms stress resistance, and contributes to the selection of effective social interaction strategies.},

Yet, the cognitive processes which underpin these theories of meaning making are often bracketed out. Drawing on three different qualitative research projects, respectively on activists, religious communities, and gamers, this article synthesizes work in sociology, psychology, and philosophy, to develop a sociology of imagination. Current work highlights that (1) imagination is a higher order mental function, (2) powerful in its effects, which (3) facilitates intersubjectivity, and (4) is socially constructive. However, sociology can additionally contribute to scholarly understandings of imagination, which have often focused on individualistic mental imaging, by highlighting the degree to which (a) imagination allows individuals and groups to coordinate identities, actions, and futures, (b) imagination relies on widely shared cultural elements, and (c) imagination is often undertaken collectively, in groups. The article concludes with suggestions for future sociological work on imagination.},

Among the factors that affect the quality of the experience, the role of the Game Master (GM) is important. In contrast to competitive games such as Shogi, where victory or defeat is clear-cut, how do we evaluate the “skill” of a co-creation game? The author has observed more than 422 GM sessions, ranging from beginners to game designers to certified GMs, and has considered the factors of enjoyment by using autoethnography, referring to both formal evaluations and the author’s personal experiences. The findings are presented in the form of a “competence map.” The author hopes that not only professional GMs but also amateur GMs who pursue TRPG enjoyment in depth will make use of the suggestions.},

Existing research suggests that role-playing games encourage the development of critical and strategic decision-making, teamwork, and creative thinking, all behaviors integral to the development of lasting leadership competencies. This integrative review theorizes using TRPG roleplay games as unconventional tools for skill development and examines the implications for leadership applications. This inductive approach revealed a comprehensive picture of the importance of TRPGs integration into leadership development programs. It is at the intersection between creativity and leadership where organizational leaders have the potential to develop creativity training interventions to enhance and increase leaders’ creative potential and emotional creativity.},

This article examines the emergence of moral panic around D\&D, particularly in the United States and Canada during the early 1980s. It explores how concerned groups, such as Bothered Against Dungeons \& Dragons, portrayed the game as a corrupting influence on American youth. Focusing on the spread of panic into Canada, this article investigates the role of American media in shaping Canadian perceptions. This study highlights questions about transnational cultural influence and the impact of media on societal norms. Was the moral panic primarily a result of American cultural influence, or was there tangible evidence linking D\&D to real-world violence in Canada? Through analysis of media representation and cultural discourse, this article seeks to shed light on these complex dynamics and to highlight moments of youth resistance to narratives of moral panic.},

En collaboration avec l'association LUDESCO et comme avant-goût de ce grand événement ludique qui aura lieu du 15 au 17 mars à la Maison du Peuple, la Bibliothèque de la Ville a le plaisir de vous convier à une conférence de Stéphane Gallay, auteur d'un jeu de rôle suisse de science-fiction aussi décapant que bourré de références au monde moderne et à ses vicissitudes: «Tigres Volants». Il y décrira l'univers de son jeu, les grandes étapes de sa création, ses influences littéraires ou cinématographique, les spécificités du genre et les difficultés rencontrées à l'heure de publier.  Webdesigner de profession et auteur à ses heures perdues, ce digne représentant de la crème culturelle «geek» saura vous faire partager sa passion et vous emmènera en voyage dans un univers loufoque qu'il décrit lui-même comme «la rencontre entre deux cultures : une civilisation qui a dominé la galaxie pendant près de dix mille ans, rythmée par l'espérance de vie millénaire de ses habitants ; et les Terriens, qui déboulent après quatre guerres mondiales, avec plein d'idées saugrenues : démocratie, moteur à explosion, vélo, capitalisme, football...» Le choc des cultures est ici traité avec humour, nous ramenant sans l'ombre d'un doute au monde tel que nous le connaissons.},

  abstract = {Much of the information people encounter in everyday life is not factual; it originates from fictional sources, such as movies, novels, and video games, and from direct experience such as pretense, role-playing, and everyday conversation. Despite the recent increase in research on fiction, there is no theoretical account of how memory of fictional information is related to other types of memory or of which mechanisms allow people to separate fact and fiction in memory. We present a theoretical framework that places memory of fiction in relation to other cognitive phenomena as a distinct construct and argue that it is an essential component for any general theory of human memory. We show how fictionality can be integrated in an existing memory model by extending Rubin’s dimensional conceptual memory model. By this means, our model can account for explicit and implicit memory of fictional information of events, places, characters, and objects. Further, we propose a set of mechanisms involving various degrees of complexity and levels of conscious processing that mostly keep fact and fiction separated but also allow information from fiction to influence real-world attitudes and beliefs: content-based reasoning, source monitoring, and an associative link from the memory to the concept of fiction.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThis chapter explores player interactions and engagement in tabletop role-playing game settings.ObjectiveParticularly focusing on the intersection of gaming systems, virtual settings, and player interactions, this chapter seeks to explore how implicit systems shape individuals? experiences and behaviors. Through this focus, the chapter intentionally draws parallels between informal gaming settings and classroom-based interactions.SettingThough this study makes specific connections to classroom pedagogies, data were collected from a multiyear ethnographic study of playing tabletop role-playing games with adult participants in informal learning environments. Data were collected from within public gaming cafes and shops.Research DesignParticipant observation within a role-playing game community served as the primary approach to this ethnographic study. In addition to fieldnote-based observation, interviews with players and archival analysis of gaming artifacts helped triangulate meaning-making at the gaming table. Analysis was conducted through an inductive coding approach that focused on player interactions, systems, and settings.FindingsCultural values, including racism and sexism, shaped player experiences at the table, based on systemic designs and textual guidance from game-related fiction. While games speak to broad possibilities for exploring race and gender, these constructs become limited through the layers of player beliefs, designed rule sets, and depictions within narratives. The emancipatory possibilities of ludic imagination are flattened by cultural norms that may oppress.ConclusionsBroadening the findings from this study, this chapter concludes with classroom-based recommendations. If a contemporary approach to critical pedagogy depends on dialogue and cultural understanding, this chapter points to the limitations of confining such work to traditional classroom settings. Instead, it suggests that an interrogation of these systems, alongside youth, is a necessary step in critically oriented classrooms.},

  abstract = {The author explored the literacy practices in tabletop gaming communities. Focusing on the role of spatiality and materiality in nondigital contexts, this study broadens how literacies research engages with sociocultural analysis of primarily analog settings. Building on experiences in playing the role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons, the author analyzed how literacies shape the collaborative storytelling and interpretation of complex rules mechanics required for play. The author drew on 26 months of collected ethnographic data, including participant observation of hundreds of hours of tabletop role-playing game sessions, interviews, and textual analysis. Describing how gaming literacy practices are enacted, the findings from this study identify three different spaces in which analog literacies often emerge: in-game literacies, at-the-table literacies, and beyond-the-table literacies. Exploring how participants read, produce, and communicate in ways that move across these domains, the author emphasizes the roles of temporality and spatiality in understanding contemporary literacies. Further, as Dungeons \& Dragons is mediated by myriad books and physical objects, such as dice, sheets of paper, and small figurines, the role of materiality in analog literacies differs substantially from digital contexts. At the same time, exploring the cultural practices and talk that shaped play, the author emphasizes that analog gaming remains connected to the digital affordances of online texts, transmedia production, and tools for communication. By considering how seemingly archaic gaming practices recast literacies research around games and learning, the author argues for continued scrutiny of these playful domains.},

Naturally, when RPGs turned toward the Gothic, they did the same thing: riffing off the assembled archetypes and stereotypes of myth, film and literature to create an infrastructure of characters for players to occupy and navigate.  This paper explores the most overtly Gothic RPG yet designed, analysing two different approaches to establishing a framework of archetypes that will be familiar to players while also curating a particular aesthetic mood.  Vampire: the Masquerade\hspace{0pt} bakes literary references into its heavily stereotyped clans and sects, strongly associating the two and extending the game experience step by step into new and broader territories.  Vampire: the Requiem presents five recognisable archetypes, more clearly derived from particular mythic, filmic or literary concepts of the vampire, and five thematic political groups that interact with them in a way offering greater variety.  This paper will establish the Gothic credentials and objectives of the two games in their own terms, explore how the playable character options embody and serve the games’ vision of the Gothic, and proceed toward a classic ‘compare and contrast’ conclusion, looking at how successive editions of the games have modernised these archetypes to meet evolving perceptions of what exactly Gothic roleplaying should be.},

It offers a brief explanation of role-playing games, defining their textuality in Bakhtinian terms—as ‘chronotopes’. It lays out the particular relationship that role-playing enjoys with the Gothic, drawing on Spooner’s postmodern “ludogothic”, and Kryzwynska’s sense of genre as defined by coordinates. But mostly, it summarises the Vampire game line’s complex design history, and offers a swift tour through Vampire’s various editions, charting how the game’s Gothic has evolved and, eventually, come to transcend itself over nearly thirty years.},

  abstract = {In this essay I discuss how realism operates to constrain games, especially role-playing games, that take place in a fantasy milieu. The design of these games involves tradeoffs between two values, which are sometimes labeled “realism” and “playability”. These values are ordinarily understood to be wholly independent and competing. Using resources drawn from John Rawls's conception of political theory as a search for a “realistic utopia”, I show how these values can instead be under-stood as aspects of the more general value of creating and conceiving a realistic fantasy through the medium of game play. I also explain how realism operates differently as a constraint on tabletop role-playing games from how it operates in realistic video games and live-action role-playing.},

According to this approach, my intention is to indicate how the use of the Theatre of Mind in the educational environment can be an integral asset; not only in teaching school's subjects (ex. Language, History, Physics etc.) but also in teaching behavior, culture, ideals, and ethical values. Therefore, it aims at student's mental and emotional stimulation targeting the integration of mental and emotional process emphasizing the latter. Thus, the Theatre of Mind may provoke and develop concrete emotions, manners and behavior through simulating real life. It is a method that may provide a unique experience for the student. Concluding, I suggest that the Theatre of Mind due to its nature and by means of a special design can function as the field where learners will deal with a holistic cultural experience monitoring and developing emotional intelligence even in distant learning.},

Voor mijn onderzoek vergelijk ik het spelboek van de allereerste editie van D\&D uit 1973 (Dungeons \& Dragons: Rules) met The Player’s Handbook uit 2014 en de Duitse vertaling Das Spielerhandbuch uit 2021. Aan de hand van een diachrone tekstanalyse vergelijk ik deze teksten op kwantitatief en kwalitatief niveau: eerst maak ik gebruik van een distantreadingtechniek waarbij ik woordfrequenties in kaart breng. Deze kwantitatieve analyse vormt de basis voor een gerichte kwalitatieve aanpak in de vorm van een discoursanalyse. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat er grote verschillen zijn in pronominaal gebruik in alle drie de teksten. Ook verschilt de genderneutraliteit van spelersklassentitels tussen de drie teksten. Dungeons \& Dragons: Rules bevat geen expliciete vermeldingen van gender en geaardheid bij personagecreatie. The Player’s Handbook en Das Spielerhandbuch bevatten dit soort vermeldingen wel, maar doen hierbij beroep op schadelijke en verouderde stereotypen. Dungeons \& Dragons: Rules kan gezien worden als (gender)exclusief, terwijl The Player’s Handbook en Das Spielerhandbuch gezien kunnen worden als (gender)inclusiever, maar met ruimte voor verbetering.},

Performative education being one of them, a need for developing convincing performative concepts arises (Jogschies, Schewe \& Stöver-Blahak 2018). The improvisational role-playing technique edu-larp constitutes one such tool, combining the training of social and personal skills with the exploration of various themes. An adaptation of this format to institutional settings coined STARS (STudent Activating Role-playing gameS, Geneuss 2019) has been applied in several schools in Bavaria. To ascertain the students’ perspective on their perceived learning, data from 161 quantitative surveys were further augmented by feedback-talks. To gain insight into the teachers’ perspective on how the tool can be implemented in German lessons, which general skills can be trained and what challenges might arise when applied in formal education, we applied a qualitative design grounded upon 7 interviews. It emerges that applying edu-larp in classrooms is perceived as a meaningful tool to treat curricular topics. It also contributes to train social and personal skills, which in turn can lead to self-confident face-to-face interaction. Yet, multiple challenges keep educators from applying the technique.},

Over the course of 5 years, 16 live action role-playing games with a total of 53 cycles of Design-based Research (DBR) including design, testing, and evaluation were conducted in German schools. This paper synthesizes 17 essential principles from the DBR cycles as best practice in the context of subject-bound curricular focus. The results of our study show that four parameters differ in schools from extracurricular live action role-playing activities: curricular guidelines, compulsory participation, grading practices, and time/space confinements. These four parameters need to be taken into consideration at all times when designing and conducting a live action role-playing game in a school environment. Moreover, design for simplicity and inclusion is paramount for successful implementation within subject-teaching in schools as a rewarding tool to foster content-knowledge and to promote social and personal skills.},

I argue that these games go beyond representing and mediating anxieties around ecological disaster. Instead, I propose that they offer a generative mode of collaborative worldbuilding in a time of climate crisis. I interrogate the ethics of TTRPGs through the lens of ecocriticism, identifying tensions between game texts and game play. These tensions exist between the expression of ecophobia—which tends to position nature as an antagonist—and the attribution of moral considerability and agency to the more-than-human world. Such tensions are productive and play out through collaborative storytelling techniques and ludic mechanics that invite players to reflect on the interrelationship between humans and the worlds in which they are embedded.},

  abstract = {This is the first volume to apply insights from the material turn in philosophy to the study of play and games. At a time of renewed interest in analogue gaming, as scholars are looking beyond the digital and virtual for the first time since the inception of game studies in the 1990s, Material Game Studies not only supports the importance of the (re)turn to the analogue, but proposes a materiality of play more broadly.  Recognizing the entanglement of physical materiality with cultural meaning, the authors in this volume apply a range of theoretical approaches, from material eco-criticism to animal studies, to examine games and play as existing within worlds of matter. Different chapters focus on the material properties of board, card and role-playing games, how they are designed and made, how they are touched and played with, and how they connect with other human and nonhuman things.  Bringing together international scholars, Material Game Studies defines a new field of material game studies and demonstrates how it is a valuable addition to wider debates about the material turn and the place of embodied humans in a material world.},

  abstract = {In this article, we critically overview existing studies on compensatory and dissociative mechanisms associated with problematic gaming, with a focus on escapism. Thus, we present a theoretical model integrating current research. In the first section, we link compensatory and dissociative processes related to gaming on a continuum that corresponds to the degree of connection/rupture between physical and virtual environments of the individual. In the second section, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing conceptualizations and measures of escapism. We contend that escapism in gaming represents a key dimension of the compensation for difficulties in psychological needs satisfaction in the physical environment, differently from escape (avoidance) and from general immersion in video games. In the last section, we elaborate the Compensatory-Dissociative Online Gaming (C-DOG) model, which defines a set of interconnected psychological processes operationalizing the continuum between adaptive and pathological online gaming: relaxation, body-mind detachment, active escapism, escape, and dissociation. This model provides an unprecedented way to consider meaningful processes for the clinical evaluation and treatment of problematic gaming, as well as the association of problematic gaming with emerging social withdrawal conditions, such as hikikomori.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are group-based games which involve character creation and collaborative storytelling in an imagined setting, allowing participants to engage in problem-solving, creativity, and social interaction. While TTRPGs have recently been gaining traction, few have assessed the tandem of benefits that participants may gain simultaneously. This study examined the range of benefits for youth involved in therapeutically applied role-playing games (TARPGs), a novel intervention combining therapeutic concepts with TTRPGs. Participants were recruited from a nonprofit organization offering TARPG skill groups. A Qualtrics survey was used to assess participants' perceived gains from involvement. It was hypothesized that youth and young adult participants in a six-week TARPG group would report high satisfaction means in domains of confidence, self-esteem, self-expression, quality of life, empathy, feelings of support, and ability to talk and connect with peers. Results from the study indicate average perceived benefits between the two highest (1-2) answer options occurred in all domains except quality of life and self-expression, with these categories still demonstrating positive outcomes. Notably, benefits were still more pronounced in these domains among LGBQ+ and gender nonconforming participants. Qualitative feedback from participants helped to support the rationale for these benefits and provided insight for areas of further improvement.},

The art of these modules reveals a genre and period-specific set of aesthetic codes with distinct subcultural rules of application. In order to construct a sense of nostalgia, the cover art highlights the representation of adventurers, monsters, and dungeon environments within a unique visual style reminiscent of the early Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) aesthetic from the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Advanced Adventures use nostalgia ideologically as a form of homage to early D\&D, to assert the values of old-school gaming, and to chart a new direction for classic fantasy role-playing that challenges the style of play espoused by the current fourth edition of D\&D (4E) published by Wizards of the Coast.},

  abstract = {IntroductionDungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) is a cooperative tabletop roleplaying game in which players gather together to tell stories. Expert players have a wealth of experiences and game knowledge from which to draw upon while playing the game. Novices, on the other hand, have little experience to depend on when navigating the first few gaming sessions.ObjectivesThe primary objective of this investigation was to describe how different novices become socialized to the D\&D culture in this small community at the beginning of a new gaming campaign.MethodsThe present study is a cross-sectional qualitative participant observation of D\&D novice socialization through the lens of communities of practice (CoP). Observation and interviews of two experts and five novice fifth edition D\&D players revealed interactions and choices made by players related to the dissemination of cultural and practical knowledge and the fluidity of player and character identity within the scope of observed gameplay.ResultsThe results showed that for some novices explicit in-game training was required to learn their role at the table, but socialization could come more quickly for novices who took extra steps to gain experience by engaging in the wider distributed and virtual community through online forums or viewing streamed actual-play D\&D games. Three interaction types?player-to-player, player-to-dungeon master (DM), and character-to-character?for three distinct purposes?understanding game mechanics, describing scenes, and interacting in narrative?were observed. Additionally, the character choices regarding gender and in-game actions were explored.ConclusionThe cooperative nature of D\&D can afford novices explicit training from expert players at the table. However, as was observed during the game and confirmed in the interviews, socialization into this D\&D gaming community also came from legitimate peripheral participation of the novices who engaged in the wider, virtual D\&D community through online forums, actual-play streams and podcasts, and general knowledge of the fantasy genre.},

Aihetta on tutkittu tähän mennessä kohtalaisen vähän ja tutkimuskirjallisuudessa on selvä aukko. Tästä huolimatta pöytäroolipelien pelaajamäärät kasvavat joka vuosi räjähdysmäisesti. Tämä osoittaa, että ilmiö on tutkimisen arvoinen myös kielenoppimisen näkökulmasta. Tässä laadullisessa tutkimuksessa toteutettiin kolmen pelikerran mittainen pöytäroolipelikokeilu neljälle korkeakouluopiskelijalle, joilla ei ollut suoraa kokemusta pöytäroolipeleistä. Nämä osallistujat myös kokivat omat englannin kielen taitonsa korkeintaan kohtalaisiksi. Kaikki pelikerrat videokuvattiin, ja jokaista osallistujaa haastateltiin erikseen joka pelikerran jälkeen. Pääsääntöisenä aineistona tutkimuksessa toimi tallennetut haastattelut pelikertojen jälkeen. Aineistosta oli tarkoituksena selvittää osallistujien näkemyksiä pöytäroolipelien soveltuvuudesta englannin oppimiseen ja niiden sisällyttämisestä perinteiseen luokkahuoneopetukseen. Aineisto analysoitiin pääsääntöisesti laadullisen sisällönanalyysin metodeilla. Tutkimuksen päätulokset osoittavat, että pöytäroolipelien pelaaminen englanniksi toimii hyvin englannin oppimisen keinona, johtuen etenkin kielenkäytön monipuolisuudesta ja pelaajien yhteistyöstä pelin aikana. Yllättävää oli kuitenkin, että osallistujat ilmaisivat pettymyksensä perinteiseen englannin luokkahuoneopetukseen Suomessa, johtuen etenkin vähäisestä improvisaation määrästä. Pöytäroolipelit voisivat paikata näitä puutteita, mutta etenkin nykyiset isot luokkahuonekoot ovat esteenä näiden pelien sujuvaan sisällyttämiseen. Johtuen pöytäroolipelien rajusta kasvusta, tulisi aihetta tutkia vielä suuremmilla osallistujamäärillä, jotta aiheesta saataisiin kattavampaa tutkimustietoa.},

  abstract = {The LGBTQIA+ community is a complex, expansive, and resilient population with a focus on identity formation, which often begins in childhood. Due to external threats and resultant internalized oppression, however, individuals can experience identity distress in addition to a host of other mental health challenges, exacerbated by the difficulty of finding culturally-informed mental healthcare. Gay affirmative therapy and forms of narrative therapy developed in response to this need; additionally, the camaraderie of group settings holds special significance for the LGBTQIA+ community, and existing research highlights the efficacy of group treatment for queer-identified individuals. As initial, promising data suggest tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) can promote self-insight and enhance connection within a therapeutic context, further examination shows that TTRPGs also utilize many of the widely-accepted principles of group therapies like psychodrama, play therapy, and adventure therapy, thus challenging decades of erroneous linkage between such games and the development of psychopathology. Due to their inherent focus on community-building and affirmative identity exploration through the enhanced safety of narrative transference, TTRPGs offer a promising framework for implementing best practice with LGBTQIA-oriented treatment groups. This dissertation introduces an updated structure for TTRPGs called Roll for Wellness that highlights therapeutic elements with a rulebook created specifically for use in group therapy settings, reimagined character creation template, and an initial campaign designed to focus on queer identity development with optional content about depression.},

  abstract = {L’expérience ludique est souvent évoquée comme étant la raison de jouer à un jeu. En ce sens, elle est centrale aux réflexions du designer de jeu dont le travail doit, au mieux, aider le joueur à atteindre l’expérience visée par le jeu. Malheureusement, à l’heure actuelle, aucune approche connue de design ne permet au designer d’agir sur cette expérience de manière volontaire et concrète. En nous intéressant à la philosophie de l’action, qui nous permet de ramener l’expérience à l’action puis au raisonnement, nous sommes partis à la recherche d’une approche qui nous permettrait d’influencer les désirs, les connaissances et les croyances du joueur, dans le but d’agir directement sur son raisonnement.  En suivant la piste du design persuasif déjà tracée par d’autres auteurs en design, nous avons opté pour une approche basée sur le Traité de l’argumentation. Cette approche a été bâtie sur la traduction des principaux concepts de l’argumentation. Ensuite, en nous intéressant aux écrits en recherche par le design, nous avons mis ladite approche à l’épreuve à travers la création d’un jeu de rôle de table et des tests utilisateur. Le design et les tests utilisateur nous ont permis de recueillir — à travers un journal de bord, l’observation directe des participants, et des groupes de discussion — des données pour affiner le modèle théorique de l’approche.  L’expérimentation a révélé qu’un design persuasif permettrait bel et bien d’influencer les désirs, les connaissances et les croyances des joueurs, mais que la discussion dépasse le lien causal de la mécanique de jeu vers l’expérience visée. En effet, le designer pourra user de plusieurs outils rhétoriques à travers les attributs du jeu pour mener le joueur vers son épanouissement. Malgré tout, ces outils ne sont que des tremplins utilisés pour amener le joueur à travers plusieurs étapes et comportements qu’il posera de lui-même.  Cette thèse discutera spécifiquement du design persuasif appliqué à la conception d’un jeu de rôle, et pourra, à l’avenir, grandir dans un programme de recherche qui viserait le design persuasif au sens large.},

Cette déclaration, bien ancrée dans l’histoire du jeu de plateau, semble tout à fait adéquate pour tout type de jeu. Donjons \& Dragons, le premier jeu de rôle tel qu’on le connait à titre de divertissement populaire, a maintenant plus de 40 ans. Le jeu vient de démocratiser le design de son système de règles dans sa 5e édition dans l’espoir de plaire autant à l’expert qu’au néophyte. Il propose par endroits des remakes de scénario ayant atteint un statut de "classique" pour profiter du sentiment de nostalgie certes, mais aussi pour actualiser son matériel aux nouveaux standards des rôlistes, évoquant ainsi la pratique du redesign. Empruntant une approche constructiviste, nous offrirons une comparaison du contexte et contenu de lignées de scénarios ayant traversé le temps: Ravenloft (Hickman et Hickman 1983) et House on Gryphon Hill (Hickman et Hickman 1986) tous deux réimaginés dans Curse of Stradh (Crawford et al. 2016) et Tomb of Horrors (Gygax 1978) repris dans Tales of the Yawning Portal (Carter, Crawford et Mohan 2017). Notre réflexion s’articulera alentour du contexte culturel et ludique de l’apparition de ces scénarios ainsi qu’autour des changements dans les quatre composantes du montage de jeu de rôle d’Olivier Caïra (2007): soit l’univers (le monde fictionnel), le système de règles (design de jeu), le scénario (interactif) et les personnages (non-joueurs et joueurs).»},

  abstract = {How do we prepare engineering students to make ethical and responsible decisions in their professional work? This paper presents an approach that enhances engineering students’ engagement with ethical reasoning by simulating decision-making in a complex scenario. The approach has two principal inspirations. The first is Anthony Weston’s scenario-based teaching [1]. Weston’s concept of a scenario is a situation that changes in response to choices made by participants, according to an inner logic. Scenarios can dynamically explore open-ended complex problems without imposing predetermined results, allowing students to apply their ethical reasoning in a more realistic fashion. The second inspiration is Thi Nguyen’s theory of games [2]. According to Nguyen, games are the “art of agency,” meaning that they provide a structure under which some result is agreed to be valuable, along with prescribed ways of achieving that result, in a relatively low-stakes and temporary social arrangement. By playing many games, Nguyen argues, we can develop a “library of agency,” that is to say, a set of values and means to achieving them that can inform how we make high-stakes decisions in real life. Engaging with carefully designed game scenarios, then, can enable students to practice making ethical decisions within a structured framework, which unfolds in response to their choices, while their decisions are driven by some defined goal. This roleplaying game–based approach thus allows students to build their own ethical libraries of agency, in preparation for professional decision-making. The approach is illustrated using a specific example recently deployed in a seminar on engineered living materials (building materials that incorporate living tissues). The scenario uses techniques from tabletop roleplaying games (e.g. Dungeons \& Dragons [3]) for outcome resolution, adventure design, and character creation. Through the game, students practice making difficult decisions in a humanitarian context.},

  abstract = {The paper analyses the almost complete absence of Polish RPG designers from OneBookShelf’s community content programs for various tabletop RPG systems, proposing an explanation for this absence based on the development of the RPG fandom in Poland. A part of the argument is concerned with a relatively weak position of Dungeons \& Dragons in Poland compared to the English market and with the Polish RPG players’ lack of interest in the market of digital materials for tabletop RPGs. The main hypothesis, however, connects the Polish absence from community content programs with how the long absence of professional systems and the permanently small market of commercial RPGs in Poland might have increased the intensity of prosumption of RPGs among Polish fans but simultaneously limited their chance to gain skills and knowledge necessary to publish and market the results of this prosumption on a professional or semi-professional level. Statements of Jan Sielicki – the only Polish RPG designer who published numerous and successful supplements under community content programs – are quoted to reinforce this hypothesis and show how Sielicki gained the necessary skills outside of the Polish RPG fandom.},

This article seeks to understand and find insights into the creative process in the context of the Role Playing Game (RPG). To this end, a short-term dynamic of character creation was planned and applied. There were 13 participants who worked in teams to create, each one, an RPG character, adapted from the d20 Dungeons and Dragons system. This research is exploratory and classifies as action-research based on the data collection procedures used. These were: Extensive Direct Observation and semi-structured questionnaires. The dynamics process was recorded chronologically, with mapping of the participants’ difficulties, points of interest and, at the end, the characters were evaluated for the consistency with which they were constructed and the groups for their work during the dynamics. The characters created were coherent, and the creation process in this dynamic was observed, generating interesting insights about creativity and its use as a tool.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) have faced stigma since their inception in the 1970s, and this stigmatization persists to some degree today, arguing these games teach anti-social behaviours. On the other hand, academics have argued for the benefits of game play. These contradictory discourses have led to the question: What are the learning outcomes associated with tabletop role-playing? This study analyzed qualitative semi-directed interviews with nine individuals who have identified themselves as having experienced hardships on which TTRPGs have had a positive effect. Experiences identified by the participants included incarceration, social exclusion, gender transition and mental health-related challenges. It was found that all participants experienced, to varying degrees, social and societal isolation related to their hardships. However, TTRPGs had perceived benefits—for example, self-development, skill development and achievement—which went beyond the gaming context, and had an effect on different aspects of the participant’s lives. I argue that TTRPGs provided a context which acted as a liminal space, helping players transition away from social and societal isolation towards a form of social participation. This suggests that TTRPGs may help players engage in citizenship. This study expands on current RPG research, by looking at the actual experience of playing these games and the long-lasting impact they can have on players.},

We conducted semi-directed interviews with nine participants who identified themselves as having used such practices to overcome difficult and challenging life experiences. We look at how participants interpreted their play experiences, described by some as “therapeutic.” Through TTRPGs, players were able to explore and better understand aspects of themselves, explore new interactions, and “test” new ways of expressing themselves. Additionally, participants were able to develop their interpersonal skills by participating in such practices, namely because of the roleplaying element. Participants stated that these practices and their therapeutic qualities also had positive effects on their lives outside of the game, helping them to enter and engage in various social situations that they previously felt excluded from, or hesitant to participate in. We argue that social interventions could invest in these types of cultural practices, embedded in popular culture, to encourage and facilitate participation of adolescents and adults in mental health services.\&\#x0D;},

Unlike previous papers, GNOLL's dice notation syntax is focused on parsing a language that tabletop role-players and board gamers are already used to for specifying dice rolls in many popular software applications. Existing implementations of such a syntax are either incomplete, fragile, or proprietary, meaning that anyone hoping to use such syntax in their application likely needs to write their own solution. GNOLL is an open-source project using the compilation tool 'YACC' and lexical tool 'LEX' which can be integrated into many applications with relative ease.

Such exploration often involves a theological conversation. Theology and Horror: Explorations of the Dark Religious Imagination pursues questions regarding non-physical realities, spaces where both divinity and horror dwell. Through an exploration of theology and horror, the contributors explore how questions of spirituality, divinity, and religious structures are raised, complicated, and even sometimes answered (at least partially) by works of horror.},

Given the increased research interest in this topic, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) report on the state-of-the-art related to RPGs in an Ibero-American education research context. In the study, a comprehensive search is carried out for the most relevant research papers indexed in Latindex, founded through the virtual repository Dialnet for papers between 2010 and 2019 in the field of education. The search chain was \&lsquo;role-playing games\&rsquo;, erasing those topics not related. Results show that there are several relevant references, even though they do not seem to have had a great impact. It can be concluded that there is an interest in RPGs in education, especially in Spain, but their potential is still to be developed.},

Unlike other fantasy worlds, such as J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, Blackmoor is a living world that is being explored to this day. Secrets of Blackmoor investigates the origins of the role playing game, through candid interviews, archival footage, and newly discovered artifacts. In 1964, David Wesely becomes a founding member of a club that includes history buffs, model makers, and miniature collectors. Hiding within the group, however, are a bunch of college students who are interested in war gaming. Within a year, the gamers meet a high school kid named Dave Arneson who is playing war games with his friends in his parents' basement. These gamers have no idea that they will change the face of this hobby forever. Their only concern for now, is how to simulate the reality of war, and above all, they just want to have fun. Their voracious hunt for new rules and knowledge leads them to the University of Minnesota Library where they discover an old manuscript, Strategos; the American Game of War. Within the dense pages are a few sentences that inspire them. The influence of Strategos changes how they play their war games. But are they really following these old rules, or have they stumbled onto something truly unique by misinterpreting what it says? Should a game be constrained by rules, like Monopoly, or should there be no boundaries at all, like a game of make believe? One thing is very clear--something magical was going on in the Twin Cities.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have produced millions of medieval re-enactors, role players, and fantasy buffs -- and billions of dollars for the industries that fuel them. However, writes Gravois, academic medievalists have viewed this engorged popular interest not as an embarrassment of riches, but as simply embarrassment. Yet those same re-enactors, role players, and fantasy buffs make some of the most natural candidates for academic study of the Middle Ages. Surely, thought Gravois, the two worlds must be mixing, as generations of gamers and fantasy buffs have matured into scholars. Gravois shares his thought from the International Congress on Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University, the world's premier annual gathering of scholars who study the middle ages, where one attendant asked "When you say 'fantasy,'" she said, "you think 'medieval.' So: Why?" The simplest answer to that question, says Gravois, is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. Dungeons \& Dragons, World of Warcraft, EverQuest: all of them derive from Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, a world built from medieval languages, references, and literary conventions. Some scholars say Renaissance Faires and the Society for Creative Anachronism got their momentum from Tolkien's surge in popularity in the 1960s. At the same time, Tolkien is an immensely important figure in medieval studies. Modern medievalists credit him with being the first scholar to treat Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as texts with literary depth, instead of just as linguistic time capsules. It is thanks to him, many believe, that those poems have become canonical works rather than obscurities. Daniel T. Kline, a professor of medieval and Renaissance English at the University of Alaska at Anchorage offers another insight that far predates Tolkien. Kline, along with other scholars of the middle ages, has begun thinking about fantasy literature and role-playing games as actual revivals of medieval literary forms. Arthurian legends, he and others say, had a similar open-ended narrative structure, a similar relationship to an ahistorical imagined past and a similar kind of open authorship. Unlike more modern forms, the medieval approach to storytelling is one that lends itself perfectly to fantasy worlds that can be endlessly constructed, reconstructed, and traversed.},

  abstract = {After hiding it for many years, I have a confession to make. Throughout middle school and high school my friends and I would gather almost every weekend, spending hours using numbers, probability, and optimization to build models that we could use to simulate almost anything. That’s right. My big secret is simple. I was a high school mathematical modeler. Of course, our weekend mathematical models didn’t bear any direct relationship to the models we explored in our mathematics and science classes. You would probably not even recognize our regular gatherings as mathematical exercises. If you looked into the room, you’d see a group of us gathered around a table, scribbling on sheets of paper, rolling dice, eating pizza, and talking about dragons, magical spells, and sword fighting. So while I claim we were engaged in mathematical modeling, I suspect that very few math classes built models like ours. After all, how many math teachers have constructed or had their students construct a mathematical representation of a dragon, a magical spell, or a swordfight? And yet, our role-playing games (RPGs) were very much mathematical models of reality — certainly not the reality of our everyday experience, but a reality nonetheless, one intended to simulate a particular kind of world. Most often for us this was the medieval, high-fantasy world of Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D), but we also played games with science fiction or modern-day espionage settings. We learned a lot about math, mythology, medieval history, teamwork, storytelling, and imagination in the process. And, when existing games were inadequate vehicles for our imagination, we modified them or created new ones. In doing so, we learned even more about math. Now that I am a mathematics professor, I find myself reflecting on those days as a “fantasy modeler” and considering various questions. What is the relationship between my two interests of fantasy games and mathematics? Does having been a gamer make me a better mathematician or modeler? Does my mathematical experience make me a better gamer? These different aspects of my life may seem mostly unconnected; indeed, the “nerd” stereotype is associated with both activities, but despite public perception, the community of role-players includes many people who are not scientifically-minded. So we cannot say that role-players like math, or math-lovers role-play, because “that is simply what nerds do.” To get at the deeper question of how mathematics and role-playing are related, we first need to look at the processes of gaming, game designing, and modeling},

  abstract = {The advent of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter for creative projects has enabled potential backers to discover and interact with creators to a great degree. This high level of interaction, paired with the self-organizing and widely distributed cottage industry of creatives providing products, is a valuable site for the investigation of agency in the making of creative works. This dissertation seeks to iterate on established work in agency, workplace studies, actor-network-theory, and agentive modeling to build a model which analyzes agency in this context to better understand what interactions between actants influence the moment of opportunity—or Kairos—and subsequent “impact events” that set the course of a creative project over time. This dissertation takes data from a 14-month workplace study of a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TRPG) and models how different relationships and interactions among the game studio, its staff and its backers result in particular creative and logistical decisions being made. In constructing this model, this study reveals the complex arrangements that influence creative decisions across the domains of work, play, time, geography, and culture. In particular, tensions are revealed between the concept of an individual as principal creator and a member of an organization or culture, and the tactics that are used to negotiate these tensions. This study also reveals a space between work and play largely facilitated by the advent of crowdfunding and inexpensive or free productivity software. In this space, a non-employer firm of one can operate as a group, a company built along a profit model is considered successful by simply breaking even, and the consumers of a product are intimately involved in its development. These findings suggest that the work/play and official/unofficial dichotomy is not sufficient in many cases, and that creative works built in a highly distributed fashion are consequently impacted by highly distributed interactions.},

The potential of digital games tocontribute in this way is being increasingly recognized, but the author argues that those interested inthe convergence of games, ethics, and education should more fully consider analog games (i.e., gameswithout a digital component). This argument draws from a qualitative study that focused on the use ofan analog roleplaying game in an undergraduate activity that explored ethical issues related to politics,society, and culture. The results of this study are examined through an educational technology lens,which suggests that games (like other educational resources) afford and constrain learning and teachingin certain ways. These results demonstrate that this game afforded and constrained ethics education inboth ways similar to digital games and ways unique to analog games. © 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

ABOUT THE BOOK   Within the pages of this book, you will find maps and writings by David Arneson as he recounts the events and people in his Blackmoor, a living game environment that gamers are still experiencing over 50 years later. \hspace{0pt} With the emergence of more historical documents, it's undeniable that Dave Arneson pioneered the play methods used in every role-playing game since the birth of Blackmoor in 1971.   His invention is both a new kind of game like no other in history and a complex imaginary world that has come to be known as the first fantasy campaign.   Blackmoor Foundations is the most comprehensive collection of ephemera from the early years of Arneson's Blackmoor ever published. It's a treasure trove of gaming history. Covering a period from 1971 to 1985, these documents reveal how Arneson's Blackmoor campaign arose from a few simple referee notes and maps to evolve into an extensive imaginary world with multiple referees and over a hundred active player personas. \hspace{0pt} Each set of document reproductions comes with commentary by Griffith M. Morgan III, co-director and writer of the documentary film Secrets of Blackmoor. He guides you through the complexity of Arneson's creation, including its game history and world lore. This collection, much of which has only recently been discovered, is an astounding glimpse into the historical writings that remain from Arneson's life. Yet, it can also be a guide to creating your own version of Blackmoor for you and your friends to play in. \hspace{0pt} Blackmoor Foundations is a must-have reference book for your games library, whether you are a historian, a gamer, or both.},

  abstract = {Miller (1984) notes that when a communicative action is repeated and acquires a name within a community, it is probably functioning as a genre. In conjunction with the creation of Dungeons and Dragons (D \& D) in 1974, the term 'role-playing game' has been used by gamers to specify a particular type of game that involves face-to-face interaction between a gamemaster and players with the intention of creating a narrative. Theorists of games often acknowledge D \& D as a foundational text, but do not consider it a separate genre from games that involve the control of an avatar in a computer-mediated environment. However, that tabletop RPGs have not been replaced by computer games and that gaming communities continue to refer to them by separate terms suggests that there are generic differences at work. The purpose of this thesis is to begin a more detailed study of the RPG genre by examining specific examples from a D \& D adventure. I build on the work of Fine and Mackay but offer perspectives from narrative, game, and rhetorical theory. While my own study must be limited in scope, I suggest a possible framework for future study of RPGs as a rhetorical genre. To establish this framework, I use Ryan's (2001) study of narrative as virtual reality to explain how RPGs are examples of texts that involve productive interactivity. In Ryan's terms, they combine elements of immersion and interactivity, and of narrative and game. I propose viewing RPGs as a system of frames based on Ryan's (1991) possible-worlds terminology and Cook-Gumperz's (1992) account of forms of talk in make-believe games. I define these frames in terms of their reference to a social sphere, a game sphere, and a narrative sphere. To explain the structure of the plot in RPGs, I compare them to Ryan's (2001) tree-diagram format for interactive texts and Aarseth's (1997) cybertext model. I conclude that none of these formats fits the RPG completely, and that it should be viewed as its own genre. Because.},

  abstract = {Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) is a role-playing game that gives players’ versatility by allowing them to dictate, customize, or create their own experience. There are many different iterations of role-playing games with varying presentations for in-person and online play; table-top role-playing games and video games (Connell, 2024) (Kowal et al, 2021). Through the 3 pillars of play (Exploration, Role-play, and Combat) player are able to customize their own experience to their preference or collective preference of the group. The balance between the 3 frames of play (Player, Game, and Character) optimizes the players role-playing experience (Connell, 2023). D\&D is the first table-top role-playing game to be created, and after a history of stigma it’s still being played today in the form of its fifth edition 5 decades later (Dungeons \& Dragons, 2021) (Sidhu et al., 2020) (Biskin et al, 2015). D\&D can facilitate high levels of creativity and empathy, promoting friendships, feelings of connectedness, exploring varying lifestyle models, balance group needs, and moral reasoning (Henrich \& Worthington, 2017). The introduction of a fourth frame of play, psychological theory, has made a base for intertwining counseling and D\&D as a new therapeutic intervention (Boccamazzo and Connell, 2020). Play therapy, psychodrama therapy, and narrative therapy are viable counseling approaches for the therapeutic application of D\&D. Counselors are also able to insert other therapeutic interventions within the game play of D\&D sessions. Counselors have to build competence in therapeutic theory and their understanding of D\&D to use this game as a therapeutic invention with their clients (Connell, 2023).},

While evocative, narrative-rich quests are still mostly hand-authored, player demands towards more and richer game content, as well as business requirements for continuous player engagement necessitate alternative, procedural quest generation methods. While existing methods produce mostly uninteresting, mechanical quest descriptions, recent advances in AI have brought forth generative language models with promising computational storytelling capabilities. We leverage two of the most successful Transformer models, GPT-2 and GPT-3, to procedurally generate RPG video game quest descriptions. We gathered, processed and openly published a data set of 978 quests and their descriptions from six RPGs. We fine-tuned GPT-2 on this data set with a range of optimizations informed by several mini studies. We validated the resulting Quest-GPT2 model via an online user study involving 349 RPG players. Our results indicate that one in five quest descriptions would be deemed acceptable by a human critic, yet the variation in quality across individual quests is large. We provide recommendations on current applications of Quest-GPT2. This is complemented by case-studies on GPT-3 to highlight the future potential of state-of-the-art natural language models for quest generation.       Hosted on the Open Science Framework},

  abstract = {This paper focuses some aspects of the self – other process of knowledge construction, from the interpretive analysis of Role Playing Game situations. Our focus of analysis is mainly concerned with relationships between the subjective dimensions of desire and alterity, as opened by the participants’ symbolic actions addressed to the future. In such an extent, we looked for ruptures in the actors’ seek to intersubjective sharing, brought about their dialogical interactions. These ruptures were usually accompanied by the reorganization of the actors’ subjective experiences through symbolic resources. As a result, we propose an interpretive frame about the dynamic elements encompassed by the actor’s dialogical relationships. We could apprehend the presence of otherness in the symbolic configurations constructed by the I. In such an extent, we can say that the meaning of personal constructions were mainly addressed to the otherness, with whom the I tried to have a shared ground of meaning. This happens as part of the process of questioning for ways of symbolic transitions, facing the ruptures brought about in the course of the I-other interaction itself.},

We departed from the supposition that the analysis of I-other interactions, during that game, could put in evidence relevant aspects for the comprehension of the relation between intersubjectivity and otherness in interpersonal contexts. The results of the microgenetic analysis of the dialogues among the players showed the participation of important psychological processes in human development. In those processes, moments of tension and disquiet - typical of otherness relationships - were alternated with moments of convergence and sharing about the topics of the dialogue, as well as about the relational positions of the interlocutors.},

  abstract = {Understanding data management in spatial data science is fundamentally important when ensuring a project’s data is appropriately collected, analyzed, stored, and communicated. However, these concepts are often introduced to learners through compliance (i.e., we do this because we are required to or it is the right thing to do), and as a result can mean learning experiences around spatial data management are viewed less than enthusiastically. Academic libraries are places where engaging learning experiences around spatial data management can be explored and implemented through unique pedagogical techniques. For example, activities teaching spatial data management in academic libraries through a popular culture lens can make these topics more approachable and reduce learning barriers. In this paper, I present three lesson plans for academic librarians which approach teaching spatial data management through popular culture. The following concepts are represented: (1) understanding spatial metadata through Dungeons \& Dragons; (2) learning to write good documentation through drawing Pokémon; and (3) developing good file naming habits with 1980s album covers. Alongside the lesson plans, I provide a narrative outlining why popular culture pedagogy is a useful technique to spatial data management education to increase the inclusivity and engagement around geospatial learning experiences in academic libraries.},

  abstract = {What might a dissertation look like, if it were also an adventurer's journal? This is an inquiry about neuroatypicality and disability. It is also about role-playing game storyworlds, specifically the well-known fantasy game Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D). Role-playing is the medium through which themes of neurotypicality / atypicality, neuroqueering, and learning as collaborative becoming-in-relation are presented and examined. In the pages of this dissertation, I bring together a rush of stories—stories we know, stories we need to know, and stories that are not yet known and still emerging. Through these, the reader is invited to explore the tracings of family, research, gaming, walking, learning, and education storyworlds. With/in layers of stories, I invite exploration and diffraction through a rush of methods: iterative walking- and playing, and emergent cartographic practices, all based in an affirmative, post-qualitative research ethic of relationality, refusal and the oblique, non-representational gaze. Posthumanism, new materiality, relational ontologies, as well as game and monster studies, support a re/imagining of several important concepts that describe, diagnose, pathologize, and intervene in neuroatypical becoming: social-emotional reciprocity, functional speech, gaze direction and eye contact, and repetitive behaviours. As a postsecondary educator, caregiver, and role-player, my goal for this dissertation is to provoke a collaborative re/examination of our relationship with neuroatypicality, and how it shapes educational spaces and practices. I hope the reader will interrogate the ways in which we embody and enact "typicality" as a neutral that pathologizes some ways of being as "atypical," and how that informs and shapes our classrooms and other storyworlds. The reader is encouraged to actively engage with the rush of stories, and to collaboratively question—and re/imagine—teaching and learning practices as storyworlds of becoming-together.},

We are interested in designing game systems where players shape and contribute their own narratives as game content. Study one designed and playtested three Virtual Tabletop Role-Playing Game (VTTRPG) prototypes where we found that structured, graphical representations of players' traces support co-design and narrative analysis. We also identified four categories of traces: environment, build, memory and object. We introduce Play Traces, a novel analysis method for representing and co-designing with players and their narratives. A structured observation including Play Traces studied 17 players over 16 four-hour sessions in the third VTTRPG prototype. We found that players successfully (and enjoyably) co-designed novel narratives. We identified three themes for how traces can affect and support players in shaping new interactive narratives. We present four design implications describing how player-created narratives in MMORPGs should first Reveal \& Pull Attention from other players, Invite \& Push further exploration, Guide \& Assist toward endings, and optionally Show \& Hide traces. Finally, we discuss how treating players as co-designers offers a promising approach for developing the next generation of MMORPGs.},

This practice-research initiative produced ten 60‐90-minute role-playing games conducted on the social media platform WhatsApp. In the process, we worked to identify and refine design strategies that incentivize engagement with the type of narrative collaboration that media scholars commonly call ‘collective storytelling’. Via the participatory action research methodology, this study evolved through cycles of prototyping, testing, feedback, reflection and modification. This article analyses our study in relation to the ‘Threefold Word Model’ for RPGs proposed by Kim. Based on the affordances of the WhatsApp interface, we suggest a modification of this conceptual frame, in line with scholars such as Edwards, Bøckman and Bowman that extends investigations into four theoretical lenses that we use to examine the stories in our study. These modes are (1) drama, (2) game, (3) simulation and (4) immersion. The observations made also suggest new avenues for ‘writing’ and creating interactive digital narratives.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, which uses philosophical inquiry, I posit that tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) can provide an educative experience for democratic civic life in the Deweyan tradition. Tabletop RPGs present an invaluable resource for ongoing civic formation by encouraging deliberation and consensus building across shared goals and circumstances. Philosopher John Dewey emphasized that democracy is defined by the civic habits and collective action, not formal governance structures. The experience of playing tabletop RPGs can cultivate habitus and space for future and current citizens to practice democratic skills and commitments. Therefore, these games are a means that align with the ends of a civic life that is rooted in an understanding of democracy beyond just a form of governance, and instead, as a process and interactions of a community. Understood this way, tabletop role-playing games can facilitate a ludic pedagogy of democratic civic life. This approach is not just focused on using novel tools to deliver information or a gamified approach to learning. Instead, it calls for an autotelic approach to citizenship formation that prioritizes committed collaboration with others, imaginative and emergent approaches to problem solving, and the ability to critically negotiate systems of power.},

  abstract = {Data breaches resulting from targeted attacks against organizations, e. g., by advanced persistent threat groups, often involve social engineering (SE) as the initial attack vector before malicious software is used, e. g., for persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. While technical security controls, such as the automated detection of phishing emails, can contribute to mitigating SE risks, raising awareness for SE attacks through education and motivation of personnel is an important building block to increasing an organization’s resilience. To facilitate hands-on SE awareness training as one component of broader SE awareness campaigns, we created a SE tabletop game called Tabletop As Social Engineering Prevention (TASEP) in two editions for (a) small and medium enterprises and (b) large corporations, respectively. Its game design is inspired by Dungeons \& Dragons role-playing games and facilitates LEGO models of the in-game target organizations. Participants switch roles by playing a group of SE penetration testers and conducting a security audit guided by the game master. We evaluated the created game with different student groups, achieving highly immersive and flexible training, resulting in an entertaining way of learning about SE and raising awareness.},

  abstract = {This dissertation uses mythological studies, psychological ideas and sociological techniques to introduce the reader to the thesis that tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) characters are intricate, semi-independent personae of their players, who have the potential to be equal in influence to an individual’s other expressions of personality (e.g. employee, parent, friend, etc). TRPG characters, like all aspects of personality, exist at the junction of mythical, psychological, and sociological forces. Unlike other personae, TRPG characters exist within alternative realities deliberately crafted from heroic mythology, which feature group-centered behavior at their core. By examining differences between character and player perspectives, especially the group based norm of heroism common across many kinds of TRPGs, the importance of studying TRPG characters as personae in their own right is emphasized. The dissertation concludes with ways for TRPG scholars to increase emphasis on TRPG character studies, and with ways for non-TRPG studies to benefit from an increased emphasis on personae play as an important aspect of psychosocial growth, especially with regard to how heroism is understood in American culture.},

On the surface, these fields might appear to be worlds apart, but we found many congruities between them. Both follow a variety of analogous methodologies, including a focus on iterative design, peer-reviewed testing processes, design-led creative approaches to problem-solving, and the use of multidisciplinary practices to create more substantial results. Moreover, both fields strive to create relevant materials for their clients, and rely on both qualitative and quantitative methods of assessment. Additionally, the interactive learning and knowledge sharing fa-cilitated by tabletop roleplaying games function similarly to the way multidisciplinary research teams collaborate to solve real world problems. These parallels have implications for new directions in applied anthropology education and research design. We note how these fields both encourage their practitioners to syncretize skills and knowledge in areas beyond their training, and suggest techniques which can hopefully benefit social science researchers working in a wide range of settings. Additionally, we present ideas for the creation of collaborative learning environments, adaptations to field school training techniques, and the design of collaborative research forums.},

The hypotheses tested whether playing a character that differed from a student with regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status affected whether students would be more knowledgeable and sympathetic to those groups after the treatment. Results showed slight increases in knowledge and sympathy for both privileged and less privileged demographic groups, although most results were not statistically significant. In particular, after the game, students perceived more discrimination against Asian-Americans. They also felt more knowledgeable about African-Americans, Asian-Americans, high socioeconomic status (SES) individuals and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) community. Finally, they felt more sympathy toward women, Asian-Americans, Caucasians, high SES individuals and the LGBT community. The chapter concludes with suggestions on future iterations of the game, including a larger n, a more diverse sample, and different methods of collecting data.},

  abstract = {The issue of academic content in games is a tricky one. Filling a game with facts and figures is no guarantee the game will help students learn – and generally makes for a bad game to boot. On the other hand, players have an immense capacity to engage with the content of games, often learning about the material on their own time and with far more depth of engagement than they demonstrate in school. The role-playing game Ars Magica contains factual and literal historical material – yet rather than turn the game into academic work, as many explicitly educational games do, it turns history into part of the game. How does Ars Magica achieve this? How does it avoid the “problem of content?” And how do specific groups using the game negotiate that historical content and incorporate it into play? Through analysis of game observations and in-depth, semi-structured interviews, this paper examines the texts, practices and technologies of an Ars Magica group in which players have successfully developed and deployed historical literacies. Players voluntarily engage in historical thinking, reading and research, including both online and offline activities. Additionally, the group has developed an idiosyncratic but historically grounded approach to thirteenth century thinking and behavior, which they attempt to simulate in play.},

It includes both formal educational settings, such as schools; informal educational settings, like museums and libraries; professional training, including medical or police simulations; hobbyist and leisure-time learning; and incidental learning, which happens while people are taking part in other activities. One approach to using RPGs for project-based learning is for learners to design modifications, or mods, to existing games. The framework of the existing game can help learners see the results of their projects more quickly, and it can also provide authentic context for the project to be meaningful to the learner. Creating the right circumstances for game-based learning involves designing the learning experience as carefully as the games. The prevalence of learning through role-play suggests that, depending on their stage of development, many people have role-play-based learning experiences that RPGs can draw on.},

Text-based role-playing games involve a wide range of different designs and technologies to support play. For example, early text-based role-playing games were typically play-by-mail (PBM). Players wrote out their game moves and mailed them to a coordinator, who collated player contributions and responded in writing to the group. In contrast, contemporary text-based role-playing games focus on the process of writing, whether individually or collaboratively. This chapter presents two contemporary text-based role-playing game genres: the individual practice of journaling games and the collaborative practice of online freeform role-play. While these forms appear divergent on the surface, in effect they have three key common features: text (writing is a key part of play), trace (playing creates a physical or digital artifact), and temporality (they are typically played slowly and asynchronously). These features are important for understanding text-based role-playing games more broadly.},

  abstract = {By gathering and analysing data from various social media sites, this study examines a boycott event, and the potential ramifications it might have had on the pen-and-paper roleplaying game Dungeons \& Dragons. The game is an intellectual property which belongs to Wizards of the Coast, which is itself a subsidiary of the much larger toy company Hasbro. The granularity of the specific game’s IP, relative to the scope of Hasbro’s enterprise, renders conventional data such as stock prices ineffective for demonstrating the effect of a boycott. Therefore, data was instead collected from social media sites YouTube, and Reddit, and analysed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in order to create a snapshot of the conversational space on the sites. The YouTube data sample contains 6 months’ worth of videos content (n=1064 videos, ≈257 hours) by 21 influencers who cover various pen-and-paper roleplaying games, though predominantly Dungeons \& Dragons. The Reddit data sample contains 41.455 posts made on the Reddit subforum /r/Pathfinder2e, between March 28th 2018 and April 30th 2023. Following a controversial event which occurred in early January 2023, this study shows that a number of significant changes happened within the two communities. These effects are also in line with literature on Psychological Ownership, and on building communitarian solidarity in Disclosing New Worlds’. First, the focus of the video content being published on YouTube changed significantly. Second, /r/Pathfinder2e experienced an unprecedented level of user activity, primarily as a result of players abandoning Dungeons \& Dragons in favour of playing Pathfinder instead. Third, a connection is drawn between the YouTube video content being published about the event, and activity on /r/Pathfinder2e. The study concludes with a discussion of why the resulting changes are important for Wizards of the Coast, and how the techniques used in for analysis may be used to understand the effect of boycotts, and what the requirements are.},

Discussing fictional worlds theory, Aristotle, Frye, and Ricoeur along side concepts from game studies, such as the magic circle and the frames of exogeny, endogeny, and diegesis, I propose an alternative approach to understanding narrative within larps that looks at the larp worlds and plot as being driven by a process of affirming the identities constructed to participate within the fictional worlds through the mimetic process.},

  abstract = {Applying game theory and incorporating aspects of games into apps with a purpose beyond entertainment is a concept that has become more and more prevalent over time. Adding features such as leaderboards, badges, points, collectable items and streaks to make the underlying purpose more appealing has been shown to have a considerable effect on engagement. This two-part study looks at how gamification - the act of applying game-like elements to increase appeal, can be used to produce extrinsic motivation for personal behavioural improvements. Part one focuses on the analysis of the gamified productivity app Habitica as a serious game – a game designed for a purpose beyond mere entertainment. The Serious Game Design Assessment (SGDA) framework is used to examine each element individually, and how well they align with the intended purpose forming a holistic understanding of Habitica and the associated potential emergence of extrinsic motivation utilizing elements of role-playing games (RPGs). Part two of the study is focused on a proposed reward-and-punishment system, designed for Table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs), with a similar purpose of producing extrinsic motivation by the utilization of RPG elements. A participant study focusing on the user experience of both systems was conducted to assess how well the systems align with their stated intended purpose. In conclusion, both Habitica and the proposed TTRPG reward-and-punishment system showed the potential to fulfil a utilitarian purpose beyond that of mere entertainment for its users, albeit with a varying degree of estimated efficacy, and with a high level of susceptibility to subjective preference and experience.},

Practical studies using Table Talk Role-Playing Games (TRPGs) targeting children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) showed how these games promote conversation amongst the children. However, the role of the game master (GM) in facilitating conversation has not been examined. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively examined the relationship between the GM's comments during TRPG activities and the participant children's statements. Using conversation analysis methods, we examined the effectiveness of GM interventions in assisting children with ASD to proceed with conversations voluntarily and cooperatively. The results showed that the GM, as one of the participants, provided effective suggestions for the children to proceed with the game. The children noticed this and enjoyed the game as a whole, suggesting the difference in our approach from SST and other methods.},

Television also utilizes character creation of different types of people to create an array of characters for viewers to enjoy. However, how these characters are portrayed can influence how the public sees the groups that the character is apart of. The “Nerd” subgroup started for form as a subcultural identity in the 1970s and 80s, and as this group began to form, stereotypes about them quickly began to form as well. This paper utilizes visual media representations of Dungeons and Dragons and tracks the changes from the 1980s to the modern day. The subsequent analysis focuses on the gender and sexuality of the Dungeons and Dragons players that are represented to determine the stereotypes about the group and how they change as the nerd identity becomes more formalized.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the medium of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons \&amp; Dragons has risen exponentially in popularity thanks to shows like Stranger Things and The Legend of Vox Machina as well as actual-play shows like The Adventure Zone, Critical Role and Dimension 20. Unlike video games and board games, the primary vehicle through which these games are played is language, making TTRPGs an enormous and as of yet rarely explored area of research for linguists and linguistic anthropologists. Participants must play, tell stories and build secondary worlds and selves all through interaction and conversation. Using tools from ethnographic field work, I investigate the features of the register as well as the conscious and unconscious linguistic strategies that are necessary to the function of TTRPGs. I observe and record three TTRPG sessions from pre-established recreational groups both in person and online and broadly transcribe relevant sections for linguistic anthropological analysis. Examination of these real-time improvised conversations reveals their performative nature as well as the conditions required for all players to agree that something takes place in the story that they are building. This paper outlines how players navigate the inevitable messiness and ambiguity that comes with multiple people trying to play a game and tell a story together and how they negotiate agency and control over that reality. Essentially, it considers how adults enact pretend play through language. It also describes the unique participation framework of TTRPG players as writers, characters and audience simultaneously. All of these elements serve to provide insight into this increasingly popular way of using language for entertainment and reveal some of why people find TTRPGs entertaining in the first place.},

Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers, J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Marvel's Spiderman, and the complex stories of such television shows as Dr. Who, The Sopranos, and Lost all present vast fictional worlds. Third Person explores strategies of vast narrative across a variety of media, including video games, television, literature, comic books, tabletop games, and digital art. The contributors--media and television scholars, novelists, comic creators, game designers, and others--investigate such issues as continuity, canonicity, interactivity, fan fiction, technological innovation, and cross-media phenomena. Chapters examine a range of topics, including storytelling in a multiplayer environment; narrative techniques for a 3,000,000-page novel; continuity (or the impossibility of it) in Doctor Who; managing multiple intertwined narratives in superhero comics; the spatial experience of the Final Fantasy role-playing games; World of Warcraft adventure texts created by designers and fans; and the serial storytelling of The Wire. Taken together, the multidisciplinary conversations in Third Person, along with Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin's earlier collections First Person and Second Person, offer essential insights into how fictions are constructed and maintained in very different forms of media at the beginning of the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {As tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) have become increasingly popular among the queer community, and guided by the tenets of pleasure activism (Brown, 2019) that argues that equity entails access to pleasure, my study sought to investigate the connection between play and pleasure and the sense individuals make of themselves and their environments. My research questions included: 1) how do players negotiate legibility (make sense) of their queer identities within the context of their experiences participating in tabletop roleplaying games; and 2) what do the experiences of queer TTRPG players reveal about the relationships between legibility, space, and play? Drawing from social organization theory (Butler, 2004) and ecological definitions (Ramadier \& Moser, 1998), I positioned legibility as the extent to which individuals are able to make sense of themselves in relation to their social environments and I use spatial metaphors, such as Third Space and safe houses, to help define the relationship between identity, literacy, and legibility, and to consider the role of play in facilitating these interconnected and constructive processes. My findings demonstrated that legibility was interwoven into the potent and powerful moments of pleasure experienced by participants, which I referred to as the magic. Additionally, I established the intimate connection between the concept of space and player perceptions of the magic, demonstrating that pleasure is in the experience of “crossing-over.” Then, drawing on player accounts of these experiences, I identified five forces that constitute the magic, components that not only regulate the pleasure possible within the play space, but also maintain the threshold and bounds of the space. I also discussed what players did within the space, or in constructing the space, that can be understood as cultivating these vital ingredients of play and pleasure. In the discussion, I outlined a path and framework for how players experienced personal transformation through play experiences and demonstrated the importance of intentional reflection and integration of play experiences toward the lasting effects of the magic.},

  abstract = {Learning and development solutions often contain some form of role-playing activity. Many live-action role-playing (larp) leisure events openly center their themes or story on leadership topics like conflicting visions, cooperation, or strategic decision-making. Despite this, only a few larps to date have dared label themselves as “leadership development” edu-larps. This multiple-case study utilizes a synthesized theoretical framework that combines several typologies of both the leadership development research field and the fields of role-playing game studies, edu-larp, applied drama, and simulation. Four individual leadership development larps were identified, categorized by type, compared, and evaluated. The four cases have some striking similarities, as they all make use of the same learning cycle, have observers, and focus on developing versatility as a worthwhile leadership trait. Furthermore, all four larps have relatively few visible game mechanics, the hierarchical difference between characters is low and urgency or uncertainty is used to enhance learning. The main difference between cases is the setting, where a modern business setting seems to be the default, but more fantastical settings, such as “samurai in feudal Japan” were also used. Character design also differs, from abstract roles to very-detailed personality descriptions. Framing, such as duration, varies from one 2-hour session through five sessions spread over weeks to a continuous 36-hour session. These and other identified differences and similarities highlight patterns to build upon by designers and gaps to fill with later research.},

Implementing such an active learning program, however, is sometimes daunting to overburdened professors and teaching assistants. This book addresses the challenges of using games and simulations in the political science classroom, both online and in person. Each chapter offers a game or simulation that politics teachers can use to teach course concepts and explains ways to execute it effectively. In addition, the authors in this volume make a proactive case for games and simulations. Each chapter offers research to evaluate the effectiveness of the activity and pedagogical design best practices. Thus, the book not only serves as a game design resource, but also offers demonstrable support for using games and simulations in the political science classroom. Aimed at teachers at all levels, from high school through college, the book may be especially appealing to graduate students entering teaching for the first time and open to new teaching and learning approaches.},

In other words, it presents one view on how a role-playing situation can be seen as a set of texts. That view also includes the idea of not only analyzing those texts, but also addressing the way game participants interpret those texts. On the side of role-playing theory, this article uses material from various schools of thought, from the post-Forge community to Nordic larp theory. On the side of hermeneutics, emphasis is on Paul Ricoeur’s idea of meaningful actions as texts. Those are the texts that people performing or observing that activity appropriate and interpret. The result of this article is one potential bridge between various schools of thought on looking at roleplaying, including a translation platform capable of enabling the move of theories and research results from one role-playing culture to the next.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Live-action role-playing (LARP) environments are a special type of social information system. This paper presents the key traits of such systems and the potential impact of those traits on in-game information behaviour.  Method. LARP elements reported in earlier research have been identified as documents and subject representations and then analysed from an information system perspective.  Analysis. In order to access the information nature of this social activity and the temporary space in which it takes place, a combination of systems analysis and descriptive phenomenology was used to analyse the game elements.  Results. LARP play and its temporary reality are shown to match the patterns of information systems and LARP play to be analysable as a type of information behaviour.  Conclusions. It is possible to not only model LARPs as information systems, but also define their traits to a degree that permits reliable study of information behaviour in such temporary environments.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the ways in which live-action role-playing (larp) differs from other forms of role-playing. Larps are physically performed forms of role-playing practiced in many places around the globe. Different larp communities often distinguish themselves from each other by their standards and practices related to interpersonal touch. The embodied aspect of larps often means that they are constrained by the physical locations where they are played. For example, it is difficult to play a larp that takes place in a large space in a small hotel conference room. An equally important trajectory involves larp focused on character interaction and relationships. The first popular verbal interactive events were a form of theater in which the audience played roles. Larps, as forms of physical expression, exist on the borderline of several expressive forms, owing their existence not just to tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) and reenactment but also to children’s pretend play, educational applications, and commercial interests.},

  abstract = {This article describes sadomasochist role-playing which is physically performed by its participants. All sadomasochist activities have a role-playing component to them. It is a form of role-playing where people consensually take on dominant and submissive roles, for the purpose of inflicting things such as pain and humiliation, in order to create pleasure for all participants. In some cases, participants agree to emphasize those roles, or make them fetishistically attractive, by adding complexity and definitions to them, and then act them out in semi-scripted fantasy scenes. This paper examines that activity, commonly called “sadomasochistic role-play”, as opposed to the more generic “sadomasochism” of which it is only one facet. Furthermore, the article compares this form of play with live-action role-playing (larp). Its main emphasis is on the question of how closely related the two activities are. To determine this, the article examines sadomasochist role-playing as being potentially a game, the question of its goal-orientation and the issue of whether or not it contains a character in the sense of a live-action role-playing character. Based on this process, it comes to the conclusion that sadomasochist role-playing is not a separate type of role-playing, but rather one kind of live-action role-playing. As its theoretical framework, this text utilizes studies done on both live-action role-playing games and on sadomasochist role-playing. Reliable material on the latter being quite limited, descriptions have been gathered from both academic works and practical manuals. The data gained from these is further supported by interviews of practitioners with personal experience in playing sadomasochist fantasy scenes. This article has two key purposes: The research of a relatively understudied form of roleplaying, and the building of bridges from that to live-action role-playing research.},

On the outside, this devastated Black communities, Black opportunities, Black economic power, and Black voting power. Yet a similarly insidious development came from inside prison walls: prison administrators honed antidemocratic techniques for constraining and oppressing incarcerated persons, techniques that would later be deployed against the ostensibly free population. Jeffrey Bellin’s Mass Incarceration Nation provides a robust analysis of the ways state and federal policies have combined to create an explosion in the scope of American prisons in the late twentieth century. This Book Review explores how prisons have served as laboratories of antidemocracy to perfect tactics to suppress access to information, protest, and bodily autonomy.},

With their global releases, a game would usually come with localized terms which are sometimes inaccurate and leave the players scratching their heads in confusion. This study examines the acceptability of translation containing fantasy and gaming terms in the translation of "Dungeons and Dragons" and identifies the difficulties which arose from the interpretation of the unfamiliar terms. The study used two theoretical frameworks to answer the research questions; the first one was Cortales’ (2012) translation strategies, and the second was Nababan et al. (2012) acceptability assessment. The strategy employed aimed to observe the subject from several angles. The local translation from the narrator (Dungeon Master) was examined alongside the interpretation and their acceptability. The data was collected in three steps. The first one was recording and observing a session of gameplay of Dungeons and Dragons. The second step was to interview the player discussing their translation strategy as well as the results of their translation. The last step was to hand out a translation acceptability questionnaire to the players which they then filled out. The data collected was analyzed based on the theories and concluded to synthesize the overall research process.},

  abstract = {With the introduction of multimodality enhancements to literature, such as e-books and audiobooks, alongside the resurgence of Tabletop Roleplaying Games such as Dungeons \& Dragons, there has been little consideration for how these two seemingly unrelated fields marry into a new opportunity for literary development. These games often have a fundamental purpose: storytelling. Storytelling has long since been an oral tradition which has been converted into its literary form: books. Books tell us their story without the need of company and are often written by a sole author. However, with more and more Tabletop RPGs coming into popularity, storytelling is reverting back into a collective ritual. However, the story is complicated by chancing the dice, multiple players weighing in on the narrative, and the intrinsic immersive nature of these games. Even so, Tabletop RPGs are now paving the way for a new method of narrative: one that is being created and shaped as the players involve themselves at the table, but also by the luck of the rolls, what backstories each player contributes, and even the music and battlemaps created. Therefore, these methods of storytelling are quickly evolving into a new genre of literacy, featuring immersive and interactive narration alongside multiple-authorship. This type of storytelling, influenced by not only the Game Master, but also the players, battlemaps, and dice, truly becomes a new type of literacy that Crits Different!},

A qualitative research design with a thematic analysis was employed using semi-structured interviews with fifteen participants who had played TRPGs. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 52 years old and six identified as female, eight as male and one as nonbinary. The researchers gleaned four themes which include: (1) Social Connection and Collaboration; (2) Occupational Participation; (3) Creativity; and (4) Societal Perceptions. This research highlights aspects of the game that people enjoy, and skills developed during gameplay translate outside of the game. It suggests possible therapeutic uses of TRPGs that should be validated with future research.},

  abstract = {The sounds of dice rattling and soft pencil scratching permeate a first year composition classroom as students, individually and in small groups, play through tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) designed by their peers that tackle the topic of writing a research paper. As the class session draws to a close, the students grow louder—some in triumph as they are able to “win” or complete their research papers, others in frustration as the game does not progress the way they want. This assignment, completed at the end of a two-course composition sequence, asks students to create a “one-pager” tabletop roleplaying game that walks the player through the process of writing a research paper, using the idea of a “writer” as the character in the game. This assignment was designed to both support skill transfer by defamiliarizing the process of research writing through translation to the roleplaying game, “making strange” the familiar process of research and exposing invisiblized and routinized habits; and to define the persona (or player-character) of the writer, exploring the materiality of the writerly identity. This paper reflects on this assignment, exploring the composition and game studies theories that were foundational for the assignment before turning to talk about the assignment itself, using two student examples to discuss the successes and challenges of teaching this assignment. Ultimately, this paper argues that having students create one-pager TTRPGs in the first-year writing classroom is an excellent strategy for defamiliarizing the writing process. It also addresses how explorations of writerly identity are more complex and pose unique challenges, largely owing to asking students to create a TTRPG without intentional and explicit instruction in broader TTRPG design theory.},

This study investigated the effects of a role-playing game (RPG) on social skill acquisition for individuals with ASD. The primary dependent variable was skill acquisition within the context of the RPG setting. Generalization of skill acquisition outside of the game-context and social functioning was also evaluated. Results indicated that the role-playing game improved social skill acquisition across all participants and was rated as a socially valid intervention by both parents and participants. Furthermore, there were mixed results for participants generalized skill acquisition. Future research should incorporate a specific strategy within the role-playing game to promote generalization of skill acquisition.},

For social skills training, various clinical practices have been applied in group sessions, as have motivational resources such as role-playing games (RPGs). In recent years, the need arose to assess the clinical impact of the pandemic. The objective of this study was to determine the impact that the pandemic has had on in-person and online social skills training. Methods We evaluated six subjects with autism spectrum disorder, with or without another, similar disorder, each of whom attended a total of 12 two-hour RPG sessions over a 12-month period. The original (Portuguese-language) version of the Social Skills Inventory for Adolescents was applied at three different time points (pre-, mid-, and post-intervention). Results After six in-person tabletop RPG sessions, there was an increase in the mean frequency scores and a decrease in the mean difficulty scores. However, during the pandemic, the remaining six sessions were conducted online and the effect was the opposite. Conclusion Our data indicate that there is a need for further studies assessing social skills training in online contexts.},

The current study aims to summarize the literature pertaining this topic and present possible avenues for the implementation of D\&D in psychological interventions. A Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) was conducted following the standards by the Centre for Evidence-Based Management. Relevant search strings were entered in seven databases (e.g., PsycArticles, PsycInfo, Child Development \& Adolescent Studies). Only papers published in English language till September 2020 were considered and their quality appraised. The thematic analysis of 13 studies yielded four themes: No unified personality type of D\&D players,  stakeholders’ attitude about D\&D, lack of maladaptive coping associated with D\&D, and potential psychological benefits of D\&D. The results appear promising, but preliminary.  Practical implications are contextualized with the wider literature.},

  abstract = {The relationship between fandom and race has traditionally been understudied. Even though more studies are being done on this relationship in this last decade, a lot of focus is still put on cases about racism within fandom. This thesis adds to existing research by focussing not only on instances of racism, but on the way fans make sense of racial representation and who has ownership over a character. Taking a conflict regarding the racial representation of the character Taako from the podcast and graphic novel The Adventure Zone (TAZ) as its case study, this thesis studies the way fans form their argumentation in their discussion on what the characters’ race should be and who has the ownership to make this decision. To analyse this case study, this thesis takes an ethnographic approach, using thematic analysis, to study both comments left by fans on three posts regarding the release of the TAZ graphic novel, as well as fan-to-fan interaction on both Tumblr and Twitter regarding the controversy. This thesis concludes that fans often refer back to three different kinds of authority within their argumentation: identity, knowledge of the rules of Dungeons \& Dragons and the creators themselves. Additionally, this thesis also shows that fans, when creators refuse to give a final ruling on the racial representation of a character, in this case, still look for authority to use in their arguments on what this representation should be and who gets to decide it. Finally, as fans discuss ownership amongst each other, it becomes clear that ownership within fandom is complicated and the distinction between affirmational and transformational fandom is blurry.},

Students studied the narrative unit operations (Bogost 2006) present in short fiction, films, and the videogame Fallout 3  before collaboratively creating an immersive fictional world by populating a wiki with items, locations, and characters. Students explored their newly created world through tabletop role-playing campaigns and wrote vignette-length stories from their characters’ perspectives. Students strongly preferred this approach to the traditional workshop method commonly used in creative writing classes, citing stronger understanding of character and motivations as well as the significant benefits derived from collaborative writing. Role-playing also fostered a strong and supportive community for student writers. Despite institutional challenges, role-playing games offer a compelling way to improve current fiction writing pedagogical practices and encourage new modes of collaborative writing.},

Rather than simply functioning as digital equivalents of paper character records, keepers serve as shared sheets, allowing all players to refer to the information on all player characters simultaneously; take advantage of the programming interface of Google Sheets to provide automated functions like drop-down selections for character options or real time calculation of stats; often include tabs for tracking shared session and campaign notes as well as scenario and game state information for the GM; include a lot of the reference information needed to play the game; integrate supplementary safety tools that facilitate play; and provide links to other accessories used during online play like digital dice rollers or additional visualization tools. \&nbsp; In discussing character keepers, we outline their characteristics and the pragmatics of their use, followed by elements of a short history of this format, a description of some historical and contemporary examples, a systematic exploration of contemporary player and designer theorizing on this topic, and an attempt at locating our examination of character keepers within the broader context of (role-playing) game studies: participation and co-creation, platform studies, and an aesthetics of indie TRPGs.},

  abstract = {What makes Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) unique among games is the way it merges storytelling with game mechanics. Before the invention of D\&D, both acting/narrative-based games and strategy-based war games that made use of fantasy-genre elements existed, but the way D\&D integrates both elements invented a whole new category of game, one in which the immersive draw of a plot proves just as important as good tactics or luck of the dice. This chapter explores the relationship between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of D\&D. Specifically, it argues that the rules of the game provide quantitative corollaries to aspects of storytelling that we traditionally think of as qualitative: character, morality, personal development, etc. These quantitative components, however, serve a far greater function than merely providing a measurable foundation on which to base dice rolls: More than the fantastic creatures and the magic spells in the game, quantification is perhaps the D\&D's greatest fantasy. Through such quantification, the game is able to provide its players with an unshakeable moral order, a numerical measure of normally intangible personal attributes (such as intelligence), and a running total of a character's growth and success as a "person." The purpose of all of this accountancy is to satisfy the very deep desire for a world of known quantities and calculable success, which in turn allows for a sense of achievement that is difficult to match in a complex, qualitative world. With such foci, the author of this chapter raises questions about the influence of Dungeons and Dragons on its successors while also providing insight into its continued popularity. With online games' (Asheron's Call, EverQuest) obvious debt to Dungeons and Dragons, such a study is especially timely.},

  abstract = {The figure of the Vampire, as we know it today, has captivated people’s imagination for centuries. Vampire legends can be found in Mesopotamian cultures and in early Greek myths, as well as the blood-drinking spirits of Chinese and Japanese civilisations. These stories were particularly relevant in the folklore of Eastern Europe, and spread from there, first in the form of travelling tales in the 16th- and 17th-centuries, and then formalized as the gothic tales and melodramas of the romantic imagination in the late 18th and early 19th-centuries, coinciding with the re-structuring of society and the emergence of industrialization. Most scholars have argued that these stories reflected unconscious community fears at a time of rapid social changes. The vampire is one of the emblems of the Gothic exploration of the monstrous. It represents the inhuman and the undead. A monster of the night that lives at the expense of other living creatures. Contemporary works of modern and postmodern horror maintain, in many cases, similar iconographies while incorporating some changes to the figure of the vampire. Closely associated with technological advance, the vampire took on new attributes with the emergence of cinematography. One of the first a most famous movies in this regard is 1922 Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror) by the German expressionist F.W. Murnau.},

  abstract = {This project explores how tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) are an underutilized mechanism for developing the affective skills that constitute the foundation of creativity and reinforcing the emerging concept of the creative experience through the application of experience design principles. Outlining the core concepts of creative experience, experience design, and gamification, along with the associated role of phenomenology and embodied cognition, the project establishes a case for the intersectionality of these elements in understanding how to develop creativity. Expanding further, the project explores what existing literature shows about TRPG ability to exercise and develop cognitive, psychological, sociological, and emotional competencies through unique elements like narrative, immersion, transference of experience, and skill acquisition. This project posits that the unique manifestation of these inherent elements is what differentiates TRPGs as a creative experience tool unmatched by other training approaches. The outcomes of this project identify how existing TRPGs might be modified to maximize the effect of character creation, game mechanics, and the role of the Game Master to start exploring and testing the effectiveness for developing creativity skills and creative experience identifiers. Additionally, the outcomes include a brief description of the need to expand research in this area, with three initial suggestions for research opportunities that address gaps in existing knowledge and open doors for more research on creativity and the creative experience.},

In this paper, building upon the views of various scholars, I argue that ergodic literature should not be defined by its specific elements, but rather by the unique experience ergodic works co-create with their participants. I analyze the role-playing game Dungeons \&amp; Dragons to demonstrate how its unique balance of formal, material, and efficient limitations create coercive mimeticism. It is this coercive mimeticism, I argue, that grants Dungeons \&amp; Dragons its status as ergodic; however, as we will see, not all ergodic works require coercive mimesis. I argue that the balance of formal, material, and efficient limitations takes different forms depending on the work and who engages with it. Consequently, there is no universal definition of ergodic literature and every ergodic work must be considered on a case-by-case basis.},

  abstract = {Livestreamed play of tabletop games affords a new medium for analysis of racialization for game studies. For Dungeons \& Dragons 5th edition (Multiple authors, 2014) actual plays, audiences can engage with racialized narratives in underappreciated ways. The actual play Critical Role (Critical Role, 2012-present) employs players’ knowledge of the genre of high fantasy to create collaborative, improvisational narratives which delve into themes of racism and bigotry. This dynamic often leads players to draw on real world political narratives and discourses in order to engage audiences’ prior knowledge and examine pertinent themes. This paper analyses one such example in the case of Nott the Brave, a character in Critical Role’s popular second campaign. Nott’s narrative arc, taking place over several hundred hours of gameplay, is a site of racialized play, problematizing simple narratives of representation and identity. This article employs textual analysis and semiotics in examining Nott’s racialization as a Goblin character. I draw heavily on Jenkins’s (2004) notion of gameplay as narrative architecture in considering the limits that racialized play allows the cast of Critical Role. In doing so, I offer insights into how tabletop roleplaying games actual plays might add nuance to debates surrounding narrative and gameplay in roleplaying games, especially as it relates to narratives of White supremacy and domination.},

  abstract = {Representations of fantasy settings in roleplaying games often draw upon understandings of the medieval and early Renaissance world. This dynamic often extends to racial politics in such worlds. For the contemporary roleplaying game, this often means that game mechanics are built around race, species, or gender. Often, players interpret such mechanics as a means of bioessentializing race or practicing stereotypes rooted in Eurocentric morality and values. This thesis examines the underlying rhetoric and implicit stakes by which race in fantasy worlds overlaps with the rhetoric and proposed stakes of White Nationalist and Alt-right actors. As fantasy roleplaying games, and especially analog games, have evaded scholarly attention, little has been said about the burgeoning, identitarian movements in such communities and the ways in which these communities interpret popular gaming artifacts. This work reveals ongoing issues in representing race, medievalisms, and the genre of fantasy.},

  abstract = {In recent years, adults experienced a decline in mental health originating from day-to-day stressors and amplified by major events like the COVID-19 pandemic, social justice unrest, and economic challenges. It is worthwhile to explore play, specifically Table-Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs), as a method to combat and cope with mental health decline. Research shows that there is a relationship between playing TTRPGs, the development of skills, and improved well-being. There is little research to validate or measure the benefits of playing TTRPGs recreationally or therapeutically in adult populations. This study aimed to contribute to existing research by exploring the association between mental health and TTRPGs by examining mental health status between adults who engage in TTRPGs and adults who don’t. This study also examined whether recalling TTRPG activities was associated with higher mental health status scores and explored if there is a correlation between time spent playing TTRPGs and mental health. A Qualtrics survey was developed and distributed to obtain demographic data and to assess mental health status using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form between two different groups before and after an autobiographical recall procedure. Analyses were conducted using independent and paired samples t-tests and correlation analysis. Analyses showed a difference in social and emotional well-being between the groups. Findings also indicated that mental health status scores significantly improved after the TTRPG group completed the recall procedure. Finally, a weak positive correlation was discovered between time spent playing TTRPGs and mental health status.},

  abstract = {Role-playing games have evolved into many forms in their thirty-year history. From the traditional pen-and-paper form, that originated with Dungeons and Dragons, with a group of friends playing around a table, to large live-action game, with hundreds of people acting out their assumed roles. The first computer role-playing games appeared over twenty-five years ago and massively multi-player role-playing games, such as World of Warcraft are now one of the most popular genres of digital games. Despite this diversity players at least seem to think they know when something is a role-playing game. When players, writers and game designers say “this is a role-playing game” there are no problems, they all seem to know what each other means, what is and is not a role-playing game. Yet there is no commonly accepted definition of the form. Understandable, perhaps, given the diversity, but the implicit agreement about its use means that there may well be some common underlying features shared by the various examples. Hampering any attempt to understand what makes a game a role-playing game is the subtle divide between role-playing and role-playing game. Role-playing can take in many places, not all of them games (such as ritual, social activities, therapy, etc). This means that definitions of the role-playing activity are not that useful in separating role-playing games from other games. In this paper we start from the position that the players are correct: they know what a role-playing game is. By examining a range of roleplaying games some common features of them emerge. This results in a definition that is more successful than previous ones at identifying both what is, and what is not, a role-playing game.},

By taking the approach that narrative can be understood with games, but only by incorporating the dynamics of game play and by accepting that existing models of narrative must be modified, this paper examines the place of narrative within role-playing games. Narrative can be defined as a description of a series of events. The description that narrative represents is experienced by the players, in an individual and personal manner. The implications of this for familiar concepts such as story and text are examined, and definitions proposed for them in the role-playing game context. Each can be best understood as unique to each participant in the game. The result shows that existing theories can be applied to the gaming context, but only with significant modification. The definitions proposed also allow for an initial consideration of how narrative is constructed in role-playing games.},

Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers, J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Marvel's Spiderman, and the complex stories of such television shows as Dr. Who, The Sopranos, and Lost all present vast fictional worlds. Third Person explores strategies of vast narrative across a variety of media, including video games, television, literature, comic books, tabletop games, and digital art. The contributors--media and television scholars, novelists, comic creators, game designers, and others--investigate such issues as continuity, canonicity, interactivity, fan fiction, technological innovation, and cross-media phenomena. Chapters examine a range of topics, including storytelling in a multiplayer environment; narrative techniques for a 3,000,000-page novel; continuity (or the impossibility of it) in Doctor Who; managing multiple intertwined narratives in superhero comics; the spatial experience of the Final Fantasy role-playing games; World of Warcraft adventure texts created by designers and fans; and the serial storytelling of The Wire. Taken together, the multidisciplinary conversations in Third Person, along with Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin's earlier collections First Person and Second Person, offer essential insights into how fictions are constructed and maintained in very different forms of media at the beginning of the twenty-first century.},

Dagorhir organizers have published multiple game regulations via handbooks with much emphasis on costumes since the 1970s. Dagorhir facilitates community building, identity negotiation and creative storytelling that expands beyond the game through transformative play. In our research, we examine how these costume regulations have influenced fantasy character and real-world identities, how the regulations have influenced perceived costume authenticity over time and how the handbook regulations have engaged with power dynamics related to intersectional identities. We analysed costume-related content in the three handbooks while drawing upon content analysis and historical methods. We found that as the regulations evolved since the 1970s, the rules increasingly centred costumes, indicating the prominence of costume in this escapist community. However, while these spaces centred on the costumed body, Dagorhir regulations reinforced oppressive intersectional norms. Our work has implications for society and business, that is, our findings can help individuals understand why people participate in live-action roleplay, which may reduce stigma surrounding this activity. Additionally, costume producers and retailers can make informed business decisions based upon our findings. Last, live-action roleplay communities can utilize our findings to reject oppressive written and unwritten regulations.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis chapter explores ideas of victimhood and agency in horror roleplaying games through a lens of thing theory, drawing on the works of Mel Y. Chen, Bill Brown, Robin Bernstein and Jane Bennett to examine how the material objects that are used in such role-playing games are given the power to make victims of characters. In considering agential things against Christie’s “ideal victim,” the horror genre victim is reoriented in the changing relationship of objects and human subjects. This chapter argues that these objects, made into “things” by their power over the game’s narrative, reflect similar ideas of agency and subject-object relationships in day-to-day life.Keywords: objects, thing theory, ideal victim, Call of Cthulhu, Dread, Ten CandlesWe are all victims of physics.– Scientist in anecdotal tweet by Laurel HamersThat we all are, or can be, victims of physics inscribes an agential form to a classical understanding of ideas such as gravity and force. It invokes a reversal of who and what can behave. As Mel Y. Chen writes in Animacies, there is the possibility of a linguistic “conceptual order of things, an animate hierarchy of possible acts” that they trouble significantly as they ponder the borders between the inanimate and the animate (3). In Chen’s early example of “the hikers that rocks crush,” they engage with the problem that “the hikers … play an object role” (2). The solution to the linguistic difficulty emerges when we animate the object, when the traditionally inanimate rock is given the free agency and subjecthood quality to crush the hikers. Upon this animation, the object becomes a thing, described by Robin Bernstein as when “the amateur’s knife should slip and cut a finger … that knife suddenly becomes a thing that has leapt up and asserted itself, a thing that demands to be reckoned with” (69), which centres her idea of “dances with things” as the kind of interplay between a human and the substantive things that they interact with daily. Bernstein borrows heavily from thing theorist Bill Brown’s assertion that “[t]he story of objects asserting themselves as things, then, is the story of a changed relation to the human subject” (4).},

  abstract = {Since the mid-1970s role-playing games (RPGs) have become a significant part of the leisure repertoire of millions of Americans. These narrative games allow their players to create a sense of participation in items from the popular culture; this sense emulates the sense of communal re-creation, participation, and ownership created among performers of verbal art and their audiences in cultures with thriving primary oral traditions. Role-players achieve this sense of participation by recontextualizing popular genres and materials from movies, television, books, and comic books as games through a selective reading process and highly specialized rules. There are RPGs covering a wide variety of popular romantic source products and genres, and role-players have created a great many styles of play over the years, leading to a complex system of genres within the gaming community. Role-playing in action is a verbal, performative art, supported by several roles: the players (who create and enact characters within the game), the game master (who prepares and performs the worlds through which the characters journey), and the designer (who constructs the framework for game performance by creating rules and settings). Since the early 1990s, when women began to enter this historically male hobby in large numbers, role-players have become more self-conscious about the narrative nature of RPGs. In conjunction with this sense that RPGs are devices for storytelling, some gainers have developed the sense that their games can be powerful social instruments; this sense is perhaps buttressed by the marginal image gainers have in the eyes of many. Gainers are often perceived as nerds, psychologically unstable people, and even Satanists. Whatever socially transformative power RPGs might possess, however, tends to be subverted by their reliance on source products that reinforce the dominant cultural order, as well as by qualities of the games themselves. The most significant impact these games seem to currently have is in the development of shared authority, collaborative imagination, and cooperative action within individual gaming groups, and perhaps also within the gaming community as a whole.},

People take part in workshops as players, then borrow and develop ideas from those experiences to construct workshops for their own larps. So I thought it might be useful to put together a method which looks at some of the different intentions and purposes that workshop activities can have, to help designers think about and plan their workshops more systematically.},

  abstract = {The twenty-first century has seen speculative fiction surge ever more vigorously into the mainstream, among which must be reckoned the remarkable renaissance of tabletop roleplaying games (Dungeons \& Dragons especially), which generate fictional narratives through collaborative, improvisational, rule-constrained storytelling. D\&D, this article argues, not only contains a remarkable array of politically and theologically implicative contents (such as agonistic cosmologies and racial hierarchies) but also entails and incentivizes theopolitically significant social practices on the part of participants – most significantly, narrating player-characters into and through moral dilemmas. Attending to players’ testimonies of personal renewal and political resistance, we find that D\&D is an arena for what I theorize as edification: an enrichment of one’s subjectivity that is experienced as beneficial, transformational, or even salvific (that is, as effecting rescue or liberation from ruinous ways of life), even as it proves culturally contested and socially divisive.},

  abstract = {This essay introduces the concept of negative estrangement to help understand current cultural interventions into the norms of depicting fantasy races. First, this essay builds on Shklovsky’s concept of estrangement to describe the literary practice of negative estrangement, wherein artists craft “more evil” foes based on hybridized amalgamations of stereotypes to create antipathy toward a subject, be it monster or fantasy race. This practice is sometimes used in service of confronting the issue of race and racism, despite seeming to reify or rearticulate racist stereotypes. This essay builds on Tolkien’s argument in favor of creating “more evil” foes to exemplify heroic action from Tolkien’s essay “Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics” as part of the structure of negative estrangement. It also builds on the sense of how, as Helen Young describes, fantasy can seem safer for the cultural work of exploring issues of race due to its apparent rhetorical distance from the real world. In allowing the non-realistic reification of fantasy races, the issue of racism can be addressed substantively without audience rejection. The work of R. A. Salvatore is productive as a case study to understand this literary practice. R. A. Salvatore has written over 30 novels focusing on the dark elf, “drow,” character of Drizzt Do’Urden. In his writing, Salvatore demonstrates a fundamental paradox between the desire of artists to craft anti-racist narratives and the need to depict “evil” fantasy races in mass market action fantasy prose. Since 2020, the Wizards of the Coast game Dungeons \& Dragons has been in the process of active revision and rewriting its handling of fantasy races. Part of the purpose of this essay is to highlight the ways that the fantasy genre is continuing change its handling of the depiction or conception of fantasy races.},

  abstract = {This article investigates how participants that have played professor characters in the sandbox-style Nordic Larp College of Wizardry reflected on planning and conducting play-pretend lessons compared to their experiences of teaching in professional environments. Using the concepts of spillover, bleed, compensation, role conflict, and contrast, this article focuses on how such experiences can contain reversals of playful and serious motivational states. Data was obtained by interviewing nine participants from various countries: areas of subject expertise; amounts of teaching and larping experience; and levels of education (primary, secondary, tertiary, and vocational). Qualitative content analysis (Mayring 2002) was used to evaluate the guideline-structured interviews via a category system developed from a theoretical framework, combining the research findings of Fenstermacher et al. (2009), Apter (2008), Banner (1985), Biddle (1983 and 1979), Staines (1980) and Kando and Summers (1971). The results of this investigation show that all interviewees drew on their professional teaching experiences for planning and conducting play-pretend lessons at College of Wizardry. Despite the fictionality of the setting, interviewees identified several parallels, such as approaches to teaching and an awareness for student/player needs. Playing a professor at College of Wizardry with a professional background in teaching provided an opportunity to explore and experiment, due to the absence of expectations present in professional settings. Educators larping their role enjoyed more liberty, yet also encountered familiar real-world stress factors.},

The chapter discusses the characteristics of performance, such as restored behavior, enacted with an audience in mind, ritualized, producing new meanings, and made special. It also delves into the functions of performance, including reproducing or challenging social order, creating communitas, and depicting group myths. The concepts of liveness, embodiment, presence, and emergence in performance are also examined, shedding light on the unique and ephemeral nature of live events – a definition into which role-playing games fit.                      The chapter also provides a short historical survey of theater, focusing on Ancient Greek theater, Realism, and Postdramatic theater, drawing parallels between the ways these influence contemporary theater and RPGs. It discusses how RPGs share formal ties with these historical forms, emphasizing their shared characteristics and influences. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the potential for mutual enrichment between theater and performance studies and RPGs, encouraging a comparative and analytical approach to bring new life and interest to both fields.},

  abstract = {Critical Role is a livestreamed spectacle of play, in which eight professional voice actors come together once a week for a session of the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. This show first launched in 2015, and, after one hundred and fifteen episodes spanning nearly four hundred and fifty hours of content, reached the conclusion of its first major narrative arc in October 2017. In this time, the show has attracted a dedicated fanbase of thousands. These fans, known as “Critters”, not only produce creative fanworks, but also undertake massive projects of archiving, timekeeping, transcribing and curating Critical Role. The main project of this thesis is to argue that Critical Role facilitates an ecosystem of ideas, where ideas change hands quickly and fluidly – and, in doing so, it has caused familiar boundaries between author and audience to blur or even collapse. In some cases, this blurring allows for incredible collaborations between fans and performers; at its most challenging, the collapse of familiar author-audience dynamics creates unfamiliar conflicts with no obvious solution. Using Erving Goffman’s model of interactional frame analysis, this thesis will isolate different areas of challenge, collapse, and change. First, it will demonstrate how the dynamics of traditional tabletop roleplaying transform when the roleplayers are put before an audience. The Critical Role cast must negotiate double identities as both players and performers. This thesis will then transition to the behaviour of the audience. The act of watching Critical Role requires a keen understanding of the different frames at work inside the show, and fans have done a considerable amount of work to help each other understand these frames. Finally, this thesis will establish the concept of the fan frame. Both Critters and cast members consider themselves fans in some way. While familiarity with fan culture helps these two groups understand each other, it also creates conflict when the values of fans do not line up with the demands of online content production.},

Building on the impulse at the heart of experiential and immersive theater to place the audience within the world of the performance and center their experience, I explore what it means for theater artists to cede control over how audiences make meaning of their work in favor of letting narrative emerge from the participation of the audience during the performance event. I propose a framework called pervasive performance that merges theatrical frames and methods with pervasive gaming, which expands the magic circle of play and blurs the distinction between the game and everyday life. This union of ideas puts audience members in contact with one another and allows them to be playful and co-author the overall performance experience. Further, the blurring of the performance and everyday life transforms audience members’ relationship to the real world and gives them space to imagine and experiment with other worlds and ways of being in them. I devised an alternate reality game (ARG) at UMass Amherst in May 2023, and in my thesis I analyze this project and the process of creating it as a case study in pervasive performance.},

  abstract = {A richly illustrated, encyclopedic deep dive into the history of roleplaying games.  When Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson released Dungeons \& Dragons in 1974, they created the first roleplaying game of all time. Little did they know that their humble box set of three small digest-sized booklets would spawn an entire industry practically overnight. In Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground, Stu Horvath explores how the hobby of roleplaying games, commonly known as RPGs, blossomed out of an unlikely pop culture phenomenon and became a dominant gaming form by the 2010s. Going far beyond D\&D, this heavily illustrated tome covers more than three hundred different RPGs that have been published in the last five decades. Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground features (among other things) bunnies, ghostbusters, soap operas, criminal bears, space monsters, political intrigue, vampires, romance, and, of course, some dungeons and dragons. In a decade-by-decade breakdown, Horvath chronicles how RPGs have evolved in the time between their inception and the present day, offering a deep and gratifying glimpse into a hobby that has changed the way we think about games and play. The deluxe edition will include a foil-stamped cover and slipcase with a cloth binding, a ribbon, gilded edges, and an 8.5x11-inch card stock poster of the regular edition.},

  abstract = {Five young women are up at the front of the college classroom, and their 25 classmates are attentive to the goings on. One steps behind the lecture podium as the others take their spots in chairs set in a row. The woman behind the podium announces that this is “The Oprah Show,” and then proceeds to initiate a conversation with her scientist guests. The participants are self-possessed and serious, picking up on each other’s comments to describe their unique lives and perspectives. They are in agreement in their responses to the question of today’s show, “Who does science?,” although their expertise ranges from primatology to cancer research, robotics, and environmental activism. Their unanimous conclusion: “Anyone who has a question that she is passionate about can be a scientist.”},

Over the years, numerous theorists have suggested several specific types of bleed, but how these suggested types stand in relation to each other has yet to be theorized. In order to create a foundation from which to better be able to study and conduct research on bleed, this article presents a conceptual model that places the previously suggested bleed types in relation to each other and to theories of identity creation in adjacent fields. The concept of the bleed perception threshold and the bleed complex of identity bleed is suggested as part of this model. The article then shows how theories concerned with identity creation from different fields such as psychology, social psychology, and neuroscience inform the model and how the model does not stand in opposition to them. Using the model and the presented theories as a starting point, the article makes suggestions about how bleed can affect a player’s sense of self.},

  abstract = {Australian National University honors paper in medical anthropology on the use of RPG in the self-treatment of clinical depression. This essay is an exploration of the thesis that healing as a cultural process can be the product of the manipulation of a symbolic framework of meaning. In such a process, the central concepts are those of passivity, empowerment, and the creation of meaningful cultural metaphors for the causal illness/ state of mind (Young 1977, Kovel 1976). The essay focuses on one particular case from what might be characterised as a developing system. The western recreational activity of roleplaying has been in existence for little over ten years, and in its initial self-conceptualisation was a variation on traditional wargaming. Yet such has been the pace of its development that certain groups are consciously experimenting with its potential for healing along lines that parallel certain psychotherapies and indigenous healing systems. My case study focuses on one roleplayer, “Malori” (a pseudonym) and the way in which she employs her roleplaying and visualisation skills to assist her in dealing with a disabling endogenous depression. In doing so I seek to identify the essential elements of the process and the structural characteristics of certain roleplaying groups which allow the potential for healing to be present. In concentrating on the construction of personal symbols through the creation of roleplaying personas or “characters”, my analysis will essentially be a semiotic one.},

  abstract = {Players sit around a table. A group of adventurers pause in their pursuit of escape. Stunned, they stare at the die that just rolled poorly, resulting in the loss of a dear friend, his throat ripped out because they could not save him. The players mourn the death of a fictional character who only ever existed within the game. Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) is a popular role-playing game illustrating the interconnectedness of drama, performance, and games. My presentation will examine this relationship, identifying factors from gameplay that suggest how performance fosters success in D\&D for both actual players and fictional characters. Research into dramatic theory and game theory reveals how interdisciplinary concepts such as the “magic circle”, the “lusory attitude”, and uncertainty can apply to elements of D\&D (Salen and Zimmerman, Suits, Costikyan). Data collected from in-person observation of D\&D sessions, coding participants’ behaviour, and watching for instances of performance (e.g. voice change, pronoun switches, or mimetic gesture), has been combined with theoretical research to determine elements that better facilitate success in the game/campaign. These elements range from emotional situations that provoke players, to forms of invitations encouraging participation (Isbister, White). I have discovered that while in theatre performance acts as a vehicle for story, in D\&D the story acts as a vehicle for performance. The in-game performance often facilitates fun between players, as well as leading them to success in the game, so a campaign that maximizes theatricality will not only result in more fun, but also more success.

Glaucon, one of the conversation partners, decides to play devil's advocate, putting forth the idea that justice is one of those pesky things we have to deal with to live in a peaceful society, arguing that if there were a way around it, no one would be just or moral. The trouble with flat-out calling Menzoberranzan the most unjust state imaginable is that it has some qualities befitting a just state. In addition to justice, Socrates calls for the ideal state and its citizens to embody the virtues of temperance, wisdom, and courage.},

Contributors from Japan, Europe, North America, and Australia employ a variety of theoretical approaches to analyze popular game series and individual titles, introducing an English-speaking audience to Japanese video game scholarship while also extending postcolonial and philosophical readings to the Japanese game text. In a three-pronged approach, the collection uses these analyses to look at genre, representation, and liminality, engaging with a multitude of concepts including stereotypes, intersectionality, and the political and social effects of JRPGs on players and industry conventions. Broadly, this collection considers JRPGs as networked systems, including evolved iterations of MMORPGs and card collecting “social games” for mobile devices. Scholars of media studies, game studies, Asian studies, and Japanese culture will find this book particularly useful.},

Dieses Buch beschäftigt sich mit dem sozialpädagogischen Einsatz der sogenannten ,Pen \& Paper'-Rollenspiele. Als Zielgruppe wurde speziell die späte Kindheit gewählt, denn Fantasy Rollenspiele können die Entwicklung von Kindern positiv beeinflussen. Der Leitfaden richtet sich an Sozialarbeiter, Pädagogen und weitere interessierte Personen aus dem Feld der Kinder- und Jugendarbeit, die nicht nur die Grundzüge des Rollenspiels nachlesen möchten. Der methodische Teil ist mit Beispielen direkt aus der Praxis durchsetzt und bietet somit die Möglichkeit das Konzept mit geringen Vorbereitungen selbst anzuwenden.},

  abstract = {Accident in fiction is always inevitable. When a character in a novel suffers a car accident, for example, the accident is the effect of the author's intentions, and therefore it is not accidental. The accidents in the narrative always happen the same way, reading after rereading. Drawing from this observation, the question that Narrative at Risk attempts to answer is, in its simplest iteration: how can narrative accurately represent accident when its textual representation is not subject to the effects of accident? I ask this of a number of American cultural objects that were produced over the last fifty years, from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the present. Narrative at Risk interrogates representations of accident primarily in novels and films--but also in television, roleplaying games, comic strips, and videogames--in order to examine how contemporary American culture ascribes meaning to the accidental. I read a wide array of accidents--from mechanical failures to failed suicides, depictions of biological evolution to games of chance--as providing a broad but coherent understanding of how American society has conceived of accident in relation to individuals, communities, and the species as a whole. Narrative at Risk , in treating media such as film, television, and videogames alongside literature, broadens our understanding of how accident developed as a danger over the past fifty years, as well as how various media influenced and shaped one another through borrowed reading practices. In the introduction, I focus on the crystallization of the mass media that brought traumatic events into American homes again and again, specifically, the moment of President John F. Kennedy's assassination and the epistemological and ontological crises this event and its media coverage initiated. The first chapter reads the role of this mediation and the crises of the 1960s as they jointly inform representations of accidental mechanical failure. Through readings of four texts, I theorize a politics of accident, taking as my initial subject what Ronald Reagan called his most formative moment: his role as a train accident victim in King's Row (1941), and his discussion of this role in his 1965 memoir Where's the Rest of Me ? I delineate how Reagan's obsession with narrating accident later shaped a politics of the accident in texts such as David Cronenberg's film Crash (1996), Don DeLillo's novel White Noise (1985), Colson Whitehead's novel The Intuitionist (1999), and Rockstar Game's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004). The subsequent chapter shifts from the first's broad historical range to texts composed and published at the end of the Cold War: Paul Auster's novel Leviathan (1992); Jeffrey Eugenides's novel The Virgin Suicides (1993); and "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man" (1996) an episode of the television show The X-Files (1993-2002). I read the failure of suicide attempts in these texts as accidents that express the limits of intentionality, which bring to the fore the nation's inability to conceive of a future beyond the ideological bounds of the conflict with the Soviet Union that provided meaning during the Cold War. The third chapter recontextualizes the final years of the Cold War. Here I read Richard Kenney's poem, "A Colloquy of Ancient Men" from his collection, The Invention of the Zero (1993), alongside two novels: Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (1990) and Richard Powers's The Gold Bug Variations (1991). Rather than depicting the futurelessness of the United States, these texts look to deep history on the scale of evolutionary time. They depict evolution as a series of random, accidental changes that take place in the history of a species' development; in doing so, they together trace the Cold War fear of thermonuclear annihilation shifting to an anxiety of genetic manipulation. The fourth chapter turns to the 1970s to investigate the early years of the culture wars. I begin by reading how chance disrupts the narrative of Kathy Acker's novel Blood and Guts in High School (1984), then consider the religious right's hyperbolic condemnation of chance in TSR's roleplaying game Dungeons \& Dragons (1974). I then scrutinize games of chance in three other texts: Michael Cimino's film The Deer Hunter (1978); Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow (1973); and Sam Lipsyte's short story "The Dungeon Master" (2010). These three cases demonstrate how chance undermines the paranoid fantasy that there are external forces authoring the world. Finally, Narrative at Risk concludes with an exploration of accident in the present through a discussion of two television shows--Breaking Bad (2008-2013) and The Americans (2013- )--and Steve Erickson's 2012 novel These Dreams of You . Imagining accidents as the fault of the government, these texts collectively suggest American culture's continued reliance upon teleological thinking and conspiracy theory.

In the first example, two players employ the cultural conventions about the meanings of colors, objects and space as well as materials borrowed from myth and folklore in order to enact an encounter between a mage and a dragon. In the second, the organizers enact scenes from literary classics in order to construct the game plot. In the third, the players employ cultural stereotypes of personalities and behavior in order to present characters of diverse age and social status.},

  abstract = {“Muslims” and “Dungeons \& Dragons” are rarely discussed in the same sentence. However, one of the earliest fantasy role-playing games, which left a lasting impact on the industry, was the brainchild of Muhammad Abd al-Rahman (Phillip) Barker (1929-2012), a professor of South Asian Studies, an expert in Native American languages, and an American convert to Islam. Like Tolkien, Barker created an enormous fantasy world; however, unlike Tolkien, his world was redolent with Native American and South Asian cultural and religious influences. Through this world, he shared with his fans a nuanced understanding of non-Western societies, cultures, and beliefs – the facets of the human experience that truly constitute multiculturalism. While fictional religion in role-playing games has been feared and condemned, fictional religion (and occultism) plays a pivotal role in Barker’s work; an exploration of his approach towards fictional religion also sheds more light on the question of why fantasy role-playing games came across as competitors towards religion. Barker’s fantasy world brought people of diverse backgrounds together in a beautiful demonstration of how fantasy and science fiction can bring about intercultural and interreligious tolerance in an otherwise intolerant world. Given the centrality of games such as Dungeons \& Dragons to American popular culture, an exploration of Barker’s legacy can also be seen in the light of the study of the history and contributions of Muslims in America. © 2017 Hartford Seminary.},

In his 2015 book, Dangerous Games: What theMoral Panic over Role-Playing Games says about Play, Religion,and Imagined Worlds, David Laycock explores why fantasy roleplayinggames seem similar enough to religion to provoke fear,as well as the dynamics of this moral panic. While he, apparently,did not set out to write a book about Islam, his insights about religion,fantasy, and narrative opened my eyes to the dynamics oftwentieth-century Islam. Additionally, as a Muslim reader livingduring a “moral panic” over Islam, Laycock’s analysis helped meunderstand that today’s Islamophobia in America has little to dowith Islam. Lastly, although Muslim gamers, fantasy/sciencefictionauthors, and game developers are usually underacknowledged,there is increasing interest in Muslims and fantasy/science-fiction. I hope to call attention to this invisible cohort.},

  abstract = {The Brazilian Modern Art Week of 1922, a milestone in the Brazilian artistic avant-garde, completed its centenary last year. The intention of this text is to reflect on larp using the concept of anthropophagy: a cultural metaphor created by Oswald de Andrade, one of the members of the Art Week. Anthropophagy is characterized by the de-hierarchization of the hegemonic places of culture and by the critical digestion of the Other. Andrade’s reflections crossed time: they influenced literature, theater, painting, cinema and music, to name a few. Applied to larps, the concept of anthropophagy is discussed from the point of view of the communicology of Vilém Flusser, who was also influenced by Andrade’s thought. Finally, this essay seeks to reveal larp’s resonance with the Theatre of the Oppressed, proposed by Augusto Boal – also one of those influenced by anthropophagic thinking. With this resonance, I seek to highlight the transformative potential of anthropophagy, here considered inherent to larps, interpreting one Brazilian larp as a case study. Although this essay does not commit the naivety of treating larp as a panacea, its ultimate intention is to highlight the dialogical and social character of larps, as well as their potential to challenge power structures.},

  abstract = {Foreword by Justin Achilli. Through the combined efforts of over 70 authors, artists, editors, and fans of RPG blogs - Volume 2 of Open Game Table has finally arrived! Inside you will find timeless interviews with Dave Arneson on the roots of roleplaying games, Robin D. Laws on RPG theory and game play, and Jonathan Roberts on his career as a master cartographer. The gaming community nominated nearly 400 articles for this volume, but the finalist were hand-picked by an independent panel of reviewers, and vetted by an experienced editorial board of RPG bloggers.Included in Volume 2 are over 60 blog articles that serve as the perfect complement to Volume 1: a chapter on playing RPGs with kids, a chapter on lies and mischief at the game table; and numerous articles aimed at gaming advice for campaign and adventure design, sandboxing, story pacing, play styles, and much much more. A true indy-press triumph. About Volume 1, WIRED.com's GeekDad blog says Volume 1 is "... a treasure trove. A tome worth killing a few orcs for." and "The kind of brain stimulus role players need, diverse and quality content." Bards \& Sages Fantasy Review says "Open Game Table, Volume 1 is the reference guide equivalent of a Deck of Many Things, ... you can draw from it again and again." Open Game Table, Volume 2 brings that same level of excellence back to the table, and never misses a roll.},

  abstract = {Immersive, interactive, and participatory performances often promise co-creative or otherwise unique roles for spectators, who may be called upon to directly interact with performers, explore performance sites, or help shape plot. The nature of much of this heightened participation is important to note: audience members might be expected to be visible onstage, make choices that affect the show, offer personal information, or engage directly with actors, in an ask for labor that is resultantly accompanied by increased risk, vulnerability, and relationality. This article uses the case study of Roll Models, a longform improv show that enacts a short adventure campaign in the style of Dungeons \&amp; Dragons on stage, in order to characterize audience participation as an intimate act. Building on previous scholarship aimed at assessing consent, intimacy, and participation in immersive theatre and live action role-play (Villarreal 2021, Biggin 2017, Machon 2013), we query\&nbsp;not only into what participation, consent, and on-boarding processes were present in the performance, but also how audience members themselves viewed such mechanisms, understood and learned their role in the performance, and related to actors and each other.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TRPG) such as Dungeons \& Dragons™ are widely known and enjoyed by diverse individuals across the world. However, TRPGs and their players historically have experienced significant stigmatization due to the misconception by some that fantasy role play leads to psychological dysfunction. While a large body of research exists to the contrary, many mental health professionals still believe that TRPG players are at higher risk for mental health concerns. These studies have the potential to contrast this misconception by offering insight into how this community resembles as well as contrasts the general population psychologically and linguistically. The objective of this dissertation research was twofold. The first manuscript used a computer-assisted text analysis design to analyze the TRPG blogging discourse by comparing it to blogging in general via 17 variables from three categories: broad psycholinguistic processes (authenticity, clout, tone, and analytic), linguistic processes (1st-person singular pronouns, 3rd-person singular pronouns, 1st-person plural pronouns, and 3rd-person plural pronouns), and psychological processes (positive emotion, negative emotion, friend, affiliation, achievement, power, reward, risk, and leisure). The variables were selected based on a review of the literature regarding psychology and TRPGs. Regarding the broad psycholinguistic variables, the results indicated the largest differences between the corpora in the analytic and authentic variables. One linguistic variable, 1st-person singular pronouns, also showed significant difference. The results indicate that TRPG bloggers' discourse differs from blogging in general in their emphasis on resolving interpersonal conflict in the gameplay process. Understanding these themes in TRPG blogging discourse provides deeper insight into the worldview of these individuals, which might assist counselors in building cultural competence in working with this population. The second manuscript used a different corpus linguistic technique to identify the keywords, multiword terms, and the word networks of the keywords that differentiate TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The keyness analysis identified the words “dnd” and “homebrew” as the two keywords and “bonus action” and “spell slot” as the multiword terms that differentiated TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The word networks of “dnd” and “homebrew” emphasized both the unique lexicon of TRPG play, as well as the emphasis on group dynamics in this form of play. These results emphasize the creative potential of TRPG play along with the commitment players feel towards ensuring that gameplay is fair and enjoyable for everyone involved. Counselors and other mental health professionals can use the findings of these studies to increase their knowledge of the values and worldviews of the TRPG player community. This could also help clinicians provide more culturally competent care and harness the creative potential of TRPGs in the therapeutic process.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) have been the topic of conversation and controversy since the inception of Dungeons \&amp; Dragons™ in the 1970s. Misunderstandings about this unique group resulted in a long-term association of psychological dysfunction with this form of recreation that is still reflected in the views of mental health providers. The present study aimed to dispel some of these myths by using a corpus linguistics design to identify the unique keywords, multiterm words, and the word networks of the keywords that differentiate TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The keyness analysis identified the words “dnd” and “homebrew” as the two keywords and “bonus action” and “spell slot” as the multiword terms differentiating TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The word networks of dnd and homebrew demonstrate the unique linguistic patterns of this group as well as the focus on the communal nature of the TRPG experience. These results highlight the creative nature of TRPG play as well as the fact that this type of gaming focuses as much on the group experience as on any specific player. Counselors can use these findings to increase their cultural competence when working with TRPG players, as well as potentially harness their creative energy in the counseling process.},

  abstract = {Resumo:A maneira como a educação inclusiva é pensada hoje está fortemente ligada à legislação. Contudo, apenas a esfera jurídica parece não ser suficiente e, por vezes, as fórmulas, classificações e diagnósticos ofuscam o ser humano, indo na direção contrária e gerando exclusão. Nesta pesquisa, problematizo a inclusão a partir de um viés ético, questionando se é possível repensá-la por meio de referenciais como convivência, hospitalidade e acolhimento. O argumento desta tese é construído em três etapas. Na primeira, discuto a forma como a escola tem sido um espaço de (des)encontros, em que as diferenças causam conflitos, os quais, ocasionalmente, desencadeiam violência. Objetivando inverter essa lógica, considero os conflitos como ponto de partida para o acolhimento. Na segunda etapa, proponho uma forma de abordar a questão para além do formalismo jurídico. Busco entender como espaços de inclusão têm sido construídos e quais têm sido suas implicações, além de investigar como o discurso de tolerância pode adquirir um caráter excludente. Refutando a ideia de que o ambiente educacional é homogêneo, discuto o estar juntos a partir da ética, desde Emmanuel Levinas, e da hospitalidade, segundo Jacques Derrida. Na última etapa, sugiro uma abordagem para favorecer a convivência na escola por meio dos Role-playing Games (RPG), jogos de interpretação de papéis nos quais os jogadores criam e interpretam seus personagens durante a construção de uma história coletiva. Defendo que os RPGs, por conta de seu caráter orientado a decisões coletivas, podem proporcionar espaços lúdicos de convivência. Tencionando entender os possíveis desdobramentos do uso desses jogos na escola, empreendi uma etapa empírica na qual os dados foram obtidos a partir do registro audiovisual de oficinas de RPG e da aplicação de entrevistas semiestruturadas com os jogadores. Fizeram parte do estudo doze alunos do Ensino Médio, divididos em dois grupos, os quais realizaram encontros semanais, ao longo de dois meses. O material foi analisado desde uma perspectiva qualitativa, por meio da Análise de Conteúdo proposta por Bardin, sendo organizada em três categorias: hos-ti-pitalidade, conflito e tomada de decisão. A análise sugere que os RPGs podem promover espaços de acolhimento, mesmo que haja alternância entre momentos de hospitalidade e hostilidade. O jogo funcionou como um "motor de conflitos", colocando os jogadores em situações-dilema, nas quais foi preciso debater, ajustar expectativas, estabelecer consensos e coordenar ações para objetivos em comum. Vivenciando e tomando para si as agruras de seus personagens, os jogadores puderam problematizar seus próprios relacionamentos e desenvolver novos olhares sobre o estar juntos. Ao defender a ideia de uma pedagogia para convivência, sugiro que o jogo, dentro da escola, pode constituir um espaço de acolhimento e hospitalidade.},

  abstract = {As texts which are based on collaborative and interactive narration, tabletop – also known as “pen and paper” – role-playing games (TRPGs) are distinct in their technological simplicity. Indeed, in their traditional form all they require is the physical presence of a group of players – commonly around a table, hence “tabletop” – who collaboratively participate in developing a narrative; and a system of rules which allow resolving the outcome of situations in which different levels of chance may be involved – the need to write down statistic information making them “pen and paper”. Evidently, this apparent lack of sophistication makes role-playing games – as a clearly contemporary cultural phenomenon (cf. Punday, 2005; Nephew, 2004; Harrigan, 2007; Mackay, 2001) – stand out in the context of a world that is becoming ever more dependent on technology. All the more so, considering the persistence of TRPGs in the face of its “descendants” in other more technologically advanced media and despite what has become the popular notion of “the bigger, the faster, the better.” Nevertheless, that which occurs during a role-playing game session – the level of interactivity, player immersion in the narrative, flexibility of the rules, etc. - generally surpasses, even today, what many of its “successors” achieve. How does this occur? How is it possible; through what mechanisms do TRPGs allow such sophistication when relying solely on the “old fashioned” technologies of (hand-) writing and oral narration? Approaching these questions from the general perspective of literary studies, the following paper problematizes what can be called a “naïve view” of communication technology by addressing the complex relationship between the printed texts used for role-playing – such as rule- and sourcebooks – and the narratives created during game-play. To do so, it addresses the fundamental influence that framings, such as rules, character sheets and setting, as well as paratextual elements contained within or at the borders of these texts, such as cover illustrations, prologues and epilogues, just to name a few – have on participants’ interpretation and, most importantly, creation of TRPG narratives.},

Analogously, past role-playing games (RPG) studies have chiefly adopted two major manifestations of literary studies: textual analysis concerned with the meaning and interpretation of RPGs and narratology, which is more interested in formally describing how RPGs and their stories are constructed. Literature itself has constantly staged its own playful nature. Game-like contests between poets featured prominently in early literature, such as the Greek eclogues. RPGs create a fictional reality that is “embedded” in the real world. When communicating within the fictional world of the game, the language use functionally “mimics” everyday language. Analog RPGs allow participants to directly affect or modify a game’s basic “architecture.” Tabletop players may point out inconsistencies in a location’s description or request additional information during an ongoing scene. Digital RPGs become a stage for “vast narratives,” thanks to the capacity of computers to process huge amounts of information.},

  abstract = {The dissertation discusses the use and impact of “literary” framing (as by Werner Wolf) in generating and negotiating fictional spaces, narratives and meanings within the medium of tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). In a second step, the text describes some of the specific and most salient framing features and strategies used by players during game sessions. By analyzing these through actual gameplay it is possible to identify the ‘transceptional’ border (Bunia) between reality and fiction to be the constitutive moment of role-play where players are both aware of, and immersed in, the fiction they collaboratively construct. Finally, the dissertation adapts Wolf’s theoretical framework in order to discuss and analyze the often overlooked category of “storytelling” TRPGs - one that, as the text argues, rather than focusing on narrative as such, aims at creating gameplay texts with heightened aesthetic and literary value while also enabling players to experience particular forms of immersion and deep emotional involvement. In the conclusion, the dissertation proposes re-conceptualizing literary framing as a defining characteristic of the fictional practice in general across media. In this regard, the dissertation argues, TRPGs reveal how framings are used and adapted in order to enable a specific mode of human interaction which is based on the figuration of emotional complexes via fictional “masks.”},

Parallels exist between composition pedagogy and the techniques "players" and the leader in a Dungeons and Dragons-like game utilize to tell a story: collaboration, understanding audience, and maintaining continuity and coherence. Teachers in a composition classroom and Game Masters in a tabletop, pen and paper roleplaying game use similar techniques to achieve similar goals.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to understand the lived experiences of individuals who actively play fantasy tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). There is limited research on the lived gaming experience of individuals who play fantasy tabletop role-playing games in live gameplay. Fittingly, the current study utilized a qualitative heuristic research design based on Moustakas’s Heuristic Research Design, Methodology, and Application (1990). This study included five participants (referred to as co-researchers) over the age of 21 who actively participate in fantasy tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) or who have participated in TTRPGs, such as Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D), within the last year of the study. Five primary themes were identified that spoke to the collective experience of playing TTRPGs: (a) introduction to TTRPGs and first time playing TTRPGs, (b) participants play TTRPGs because it is social, (c) participants get personal benefits from playing TTRPGs, (d) playing these types of games is a large commitment for participants, and (e) creating stories together. The data gathered in the study were examined with previously completed research in the area of TTRPGs and role-playing games. This study identified and discussed limitations such as researcher bias, time dedicated to a qualitative study, and the total number of participants. Recommendations for future research include exploring levels of experience of TTRPGs players, generalizability with gender, and a suggestion for a mixed-method study to explore further the areas that are limited in qualitative studies.},

  abstract = {In this thesis I posit that sound – including music, the voice, and ambient and environmental noises – is necessary for creating immersive environments in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). It is the first ethnomusicological study to examine the role of sound in these TRPGs, although previous, related musicological scholarship has focused on video game and computer role-playing games (Cheng, 2014; Miller, 2012). Throughout the thesis, I draw on my own experiences with these games, participant-observation and observation of other TRPG groups, and interviews I completed with eighteen informants. Through analysis and interpretation of data collected using these fieldwork methods, I examine specific examples of how music is used in gaming sessions, explore how the use of music relates to Daniel Mackay’s “imaginary-entertainment environment” (2001), and offer the term “movie simile” to describe common comparisons that players make between film and TRPG soundtracks. My theoretical framework on voice draws from Brian Kane’s model (2014) to discuss how players utilize echos, logos, topos, and technê to create meaning and worlds in their games, as well as to illustrate how real-life experiences with the voice affect a player’s reception of natural and character voices. Additionally, I offer the term “haptic audition” to describe how tactility and space affect the ways in which players experience these sonic gaming environments. Throughout the thesis, I describe my model of sonic and perceptual layers that include the musical layer, the vocal layer, and the third and fourth layers, which include ambient and environmental noises, respectively.},

  abstract = {This study explores the experiences of Dungeons \& Dragons players from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States. I argue that even though D\&D players were opening the same books and working within the same rule sets, the stories they created, and the experiences born of those stories, are unique and entirely their own. While widespread social and cultural factors—the wave of negative press from the Satanic Panic and common beliefs on gender dynamics, for instance—may have influenced how people engaged with the game and other players, factors like location, familial religious affiliations, and the general attitudes of parents and friends, also played a role in shaping player decisions and interactions. From a series of fourteen oral histories I conducted in the fall of 2022, I extracted three main themes across conversations: identity, community, and culture. Identity, chapter two, explores small group dynamics and roleplaying, specifically how players used the game as a space for performing identity and what identities people brought to the table. The third chapter, Community, investigates how individuals chose to interact with the larger circle of D\&D players though opportunities like gaming clubs and conventions. Finally, the fourth chapter, Culture, examines the ways that player’s experiences were shaped by perceptions of the game resulting from pervasive stereotypes or Satanic Panic fears present in mainstream American culture. This study reifies the connections between individual voices and the D\&D subculture; that subculture and the mainstream culture; and the relationship between the individual player and the culture at large. For D\&D players, the game was, and remains, a tool for self-reflection, an outlet for creative expression, and a tether to a supportive community.},

  abstract = {Abstract Editorial Lento pero seguro, seguimos adelante Estamos muy contentos de seguir con este proyecto que ha tenido gran éxito, contamos con registro de descargas de más de 130 instituciones universitarias de 74 países, además de posicionarnos poco a poco como una revista académica de gran nivel gracias a las políticas estrictas que seguimos número tras número. En esta ocasión los trabajos presentados dan muestra de la madurez que estamos alcanzando como revista, como primer artículo tenemos Las figuras de juegos de rol como soporte para la apropiación de personajes, texto que nos habla de la gran relevancia que tienen las miniaturas en el acto de jugar rol, además de la íntima relación entre los jugadores y las miniaturas de sus personajes como una representación con fundamento estético y recreativo. El texto también traza la evolución de estas prácticas, desde los orígenes de los juegos de guerra históricos hasta la irrupción de la impresión 3D. Nuestro segundo texto titulado El Big Model como herramienta de análisis y diagnóstico, nos introduce a un marco teórico fundamental para comprender los juegos de rol desde una perspectiva holística. El Big Model, desarrollado por Ron Edwards, propone una integración de diferentes elementos, como el Sistema, la Situación, la Exploración, el Desempeño y la Comunidad, para analizar y diagnosticar las dinámicas inherentes a estas prácticas. Esta aproximación sistémica permite una comprensión más profunda de los mecanismos que subyacen a la creación de la experiencia de juego, así como las interacciones entre los diversos componentes que la conforman. Por otro lado, en el texto Performatividad, perspectiva lúdica y cyborgs políticos en Monsterhearts, se analizan los juegos de rol desde una perspectiva teórico – discursiva de la “performatividad” de Judith Butler y el concepto de “corporalidad” de Donna Haraway, entendiendo el juego de rol como un espacio de subversión que genera identidades sociales. El texto explora cómo estos juegos, al proponer la interpretación de personajes monstruosos y marginales, se convierten en espacios de reflexión y cuestionamiento de las normas sociales y de género. El cuarto y último artículo formal, Estética relacional de los juegos de rol, nos invita a adentrarnos en la dimensión estética de estas prácticas lúdicas. Partiendo de la teoría de la “estética relacional” propuesta por Nicolas Bourriaud, el autor analiza cómo los juegos de rol generan espacios de interacción social y construcción de significados compartidos. Más allá de los aspectos meramente mecánicos o narrativos, el texto destaca la importancia de la dimensión relacional y colaborativa inherente a los juegos de rol, en los que los jugadores co-crean una experiencia estética única a través de la interpretación de personajes y la negociación de significados. La reseña de este número es sobre el libro Elusive Shift: How Role-Playing Games Forged Their Identity de Jon Peterson, texto que trabaja Edgar Meritano para darnos a conocer el contenido del libro con gran detalle, haciendo énfasis en sus características relevantes, de esta forma la reseña aborda cuestiones clave, como la transición de temáticas históricas a mundos de fantasía y ciencia ficción, las implicaciones de las narrativas emergentes en las formas de juego y la construcción de personajes, así como la proyección e identificación de los jugadores con sus avatares ficticios. En conjunto, estos artículos nos brindan una mirada multifacética y enriquecedora sobre los juegos de rol desde una perspectiva académica y formal. Por último, reitero la invitación a participar con artículos (que pasan por el proceso de evaluación por pares), reseñas, avances de investigación o presentaciones de tesis, recuerden que el journal es de quienes colaboran en él y agradecemos que sigan confiando en el Journal of Roleplaying Studies and STEAM.

  abstract = {The Dungeons \& Dragons module Ravenloft (1983) uses the novel Dracula (1897) to create a new story for a new format and while the texts are set during different timeperiods, they both respond in similar ways to the women’s movements of their time. Dracula corresponds to the rise of the New Woman in the 1800s and Ravenloft came out during what is described as a time of “backlash” against the women’s movement ofthe 1970s. This essay uses this historical context and transmediation to compare and analyze the two works and show how they both use idealized female characters, with adaptation to their respective time periods, to impose limitations on female independence and autonomy. The ideals in both works are competent female characters whose safety and wellbeing are still predicated on their relationships to the men in theirlives. By contrast, female characters who strive for independence and power face punishment and death from the narrative. In this way both works espouse a singular ideal way to exist as a woman and that any step outside of this inevitably leads to hardship and suffering.},

While there has been research about larp in relation to topics such as embodied interaction, playfulness and futuring published in HCI venues since the early 2000s, there is not yet a compilation of this knowledge. In this paper, we synthesise knowledge about larp and larp-adjacent work within the domain of HCI. We present a practitioner overview from an expert group of larp researchers, the results of a literature review, and highlight particular larp research exemplars which all work together to showcase the diverse set of ways that larp can be utilised in relation to HCI topics and research. This paper identifies the need for further discussions toward establishing best practices for utilising larp in relation to HCI research, as well as advocating for increased engagement with larps outside academia.},

  abstract = {While online virtual worlds draw increasingly wider audiences of players and scholars alike, offline games continue to evolve into more complex and socially layered forms as well. This dissertation argues that virtual worlds need not exist as online, digital environments alone and probes three genres of non-digital gaming for evidence of the virtual: tabletop role-playing games, murder-mystery events, and localized alternate reality games. More broadly, then, this dissertation is about deliberate make-belief: practiced by adults, taken seriously by participants, engaged with for long hours at a time, performed in public, and integrated into everyday social relationships. Drawing on scholars who study games as social activities (McGonigal 2006, Montola 2012) and social institutions (Goffman 1974, Searle 1995), I present three ethnographic case studies that illustrate how complex forms of social gaming can conjure and sustain environments best understood as analog virtual worlds. Through the widespread use of mobile technologies and the concerted efforts of innovators, game spaces are increasingly permeating our everyday lives on- and offline. This dissolving boundary demands anthropologists to revisit questions of how, where, and with whom we play games. Dovetailing Martin Heidegger’s notions of worlding and poiesis to the semiotics of C.S. Peirce, this dissertation investigates how new forms of social gaming demonstrate the same qualities of shared intentionality, intersubjectivity, and performance essential to the production of new social meaning and cultural forms. Following, I situate the bold ethnographic case studies of make-belief in dialogue with scholars who figure exclusively online virtual worlds (Castronova 2005, Taylor 2006, Boellstorff 2008) and argue that analyzing both on- and offline virtual worlds together can help scholars better understand the fundamental nature of social interaction and shared intentionality, those everyday mechanisms that both sustain personal relationships on the one hand and maintain our broadest and most serious social institutions on the other.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games have experienced a surge of popularity in recent years, as games such as Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) now boast over fifty million active players worldwide. Several of these games include options for players to choose characters with deep connections to music, the best known being the iconic Bard, often portrayed as a mischievous lutenist and storyteller, singing their way into and out of problems. A musical Bard was not always the standard, however, as an examination of the fifty-year history of D\&D reveals a character originally modeled on a rogue that steadily grew in its dependence on music. Instead of relying on weapons or thievery, modern Bards primarily utilize music to accomplish their goals through charismatic performances. Similar to Roger Moseley’s framing of what it means to “play” in musical ways in video games, Bards now grant gamers the experience of “performing” magical music, bolstering a sense of otherworldliness in the game environment. Unlike video games, however, the music created by a Bard is usually silent. Players are directed to give vivid descriptions of their performances, and then roll dice to determine quality and effectiveness, but sounding music is rarely required.This essay explores how the Bard has evolved in D\&D and considers the question of what that change says about music as a non-sounding tool in gameplay. Building on ludomusicological theories of music performance, as well as neurological studies of the brain’s response to internal imagining of musical stimuli, I contend the development of the Bard in D\&D reflects a desire for expanded social gameplay, and creates opportunities for creative problem solving and deeper immersion in a shared collective imagination. I argue that musical imagery, like sounding music, has the ability to shape a gamer’s experience and helps create a richly decorated imagined fantasy world.},

As an Illustrator and Storyteller, I carry a responsibility for depicting a way that the world may be remembered. When our stories paint only a picture of a triumphant and moral people we do not only a disservice to the struggles of those same people, but also to the people we are, and hope to be. Nostalgia is looking back through a fog of variations on the same story told over and over again until we feel it instead of saying it. Unexamined nostalgia –unarticulated memories– leave us vulerable to stories that we don’t realize we’re telling ourselves.},

The necromancer is often depicted as a mere cackling villain, using her power over death to forward her evil agenda. In this way, necromancy has been philosophically maligned. Although necromancers were traditionally considered to be evil in Dungeons Dragons (DD), the game came to accommodate the idea that necromancers, in theory, could be neutral, or even good-aligned, with their powers used for the greater good. The distaste for necromancy and its mindless minions is instead a relic of “pre-theoretical intuition” a common-sense belief that may not hold up to philosophical scrutiny. Films and TV series depict the walking dead as ravenous, brain-eating monstrosities. Next to such depictions, the relatively harmless nature of Dungeons Dragons’ mindless undead is easy to overlook.},

Although most definitely a game, Dungeons \& Dragons also exhibits characteristics suggestive of a ritual. This study examines how intersections of ritual and play (“ritualized play”) manifest within the context of Dungeons \& Dragons. In testing Matan Shapiro’s theory of “ritualized play” (that play experiences and ritual experiences can be enacted within the same event), I argue that this concept applies to Dungeons \& Dragons. Through engagement in a ritualized play space, D\&D players yield rewards of both play and ritual, namely the ability to reject/subvert the social order, the ability to ratify/uphold the social order, and a sense of communitas. However, rituals aren’t always enacted perfectly, threatening the “ritual” aspect of Dungeons \& Dragons, and resulting in a failure to produce the rewards promised.},

An analysis of 31 sourcebooks shows how many of the harmful discourses present in wider geek culture are interwoven with progressive ideas in the second edition of~Exalted.~Specifically, women’s roles are limited to those of virgin, (monstrous) mother or ‘prostitute’; sexual ‘deviance’ is pathologised; and a colonial geopolitics of race, sex and gender is reproduced. Given the importance of gaming culture to contemporary popular culture and politics, the study advocates for ethnographic engagement with actual gameplay to supplement feminist analysis of RPG sourcebooks.},

  abstract = {Tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) are set apart from other interactive artforms by the core assumption that their game worlds and game systems can change even during play. This quality, which I call malleability, underpins free choice of action by players, and runtime redesign by Game Masters (GMs.) Despite the importance of this unique quality, on the eve of TTRPGs’ 50th anniversary, there are still no computer adaptations of the medium which both retain full malleability, and make meaningful use of modern computers’ processing power.Computer roleplaying games (CRPGs) use modern computers’ storage andprocessing capabilities to present large worlds and deep gameplay mechanics, while keeping large amounts of information manageable with slick interfaces and audio-visual feedback. However, because they are completely mediated by the computer, they give up all malleability.Virtual tabletops (VTTs) offer somewhat more malleability than CRPGs byonly partially mediating gameplay. Nevertheless, much of what would be malleable in traditional play is static during VTT play. Furthermore, because VTTs focus on faithfully recreating game systems and accessories which evolved in an analog context, their gains from existing as software are mainly limited to networked play and improved graphics.In this thesis, I present a novel software system which supports complex game-play mechanics and information-rich user interfaces, while also offering malleability of a game’s rules and world at runtime. As part of my justification for developing this system, I give the first comprehensive account of malleability and its importance to the design and play of TTRPGs, and I propose and defend a novel method for quantitatively analyzing the complexity of TTRPG systems.},

The author utilizes Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann’s concept of the excursion to analyze how participants use roleplay in Dungeons and Dragons to achieve empowerment. Many of the women interviewed described being subjected to gendered behavioral expectations both in their everyday life and during gameplay. With an empowering gaming group, however, roleplay allowed the participants to challenge, and subvert, those gendered expectations. The author concludes that roleplay provides an empowering excursion from everyday life that allows women participants to deal with frustration about gendered treatment and challenge institutional gender roles},

  abstract = {The third book in a multivolume series dedicated to the critical study of the virtual worlds of video game narrative and story. Third Person examines vast narratives across diverse media ranging from comic books to television and video games to literature. Electronic games have established a huge international market, significantly outselling non-digital games; people spend more money on The Sims than on "Monopoly" or even on "Magic: the Gathering." Yet it is widely believed that the market for electronic literature -- predicted by some to be the future of the written word -- languishes. Even bestselling author Stephen King achieved disappointing results with his online publication of "Riding the Bullet" and "The Plant." Isn't it possible, though, that many hugely successful computer games -- those that depend on or at least utilize storytelling conventions of narrative, character, and theme -- can be seen as examples of electronic literature? And isn't it likely that the truly significant new forms of electronic literature will prove to be (like games) so deeply interactive and procedural that it would be impossible to present them as paper-like "e-books"? The editors of First Person have gathered a remarkably diverse group of new media theorists and practitioners to consider the relationship between "story" and "game," as well as the new kinds of artistic creation (literary, performative, playful) that have become possible in the digital environment. This landmark collection is organized as a series of discussions among creators and theorists; each section includes three presentations, with each presentation followed by two responses. Topics considered range from "Cyberdrama" to "Ludology" (the study of games), to "The Pixel/The Line" to "Beyond Chat." The conversational structure inspired contributors to revise, update, and expand their presentations as they prepared them for the book, and the panel discussions have overflowed into a First Person web site (created in conjunction with the online journal Electronic Book Review).},

  abstract = {Do certain psychological tendencies exist in analog role-playing gamers compared with other gamers or non-gamers? Our study addresses this questions by conducting online quantitative surveys of gamers and members of related subcultures in a two-stage process. The first study measured their personality traits with the Big Five Inventory (BFI-20; Gouvia et al., 2021); perspective taking and empathy with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) (Davis 1980); and attachment styles with the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) scale. The second stage measured absorption, fantasy proneness and other characteristics through the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Short Form (MPS) absorption scale (Patrick et al. 2002) and sensitivity to psychological material either in the unconscious and/or the external environment (Thalbourne and Maltby 2008) with the Revised Transliminality Scale (Lange et al. 2000).  Our survey gathered data from 332 respondents, of which 214 self-defined as “gamer” and 118 self-identified as “non-gamer.” A preliminary analysis of our data found that live action role-players (larpers) that had been participated in at least one game in the last year, showed higher scores than players who had not larped in the last year in: openness to experience, extraversion, neuroticism, avoidant attachment style, absorption, and, transliminality. Furthermore, in participants who enjoyed playing any type of analog role-playing game vs. those who did not report enjoying any RPGs, we found: higher openness to experience, higher neuroticism, higher absorption, and higher transliminality. The scores of self-identified “gamers” and “non-gamers” showed significant differences. Non-gamers showed higher conscientiousness, higher agreeableness, and higher perspective taking. Gamers showed higher fantasy-proneness, a subscale of absorption. * * * This research is part of the Games \& Society Lab at the Department of Game Design, Uppsala University Campus Gotland.},

Among deficits previously identified by researchers working with students served through special education are delays in oral language development and greater externalization in locus of control, a construct of personality. This study investigates the effects of simulation game play upon remediation of these deficit areas. Participating in the study were 26 mildly handicapped adolescents. The experimental group, consisting of 13 students, played Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy-based role-playing game, during 18 sessions. All participants were administered individual tests utilizing the Utah Test of Language Development, Revised Edition and the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire after the final session of play. Findings and Conclusions. One-way analysis of variance tests using the difference between the group means on (1) oral language development and (2) internal versus external locus of control was applied. A significant difference was found to exist at the .05 level in oral language development. A significant difference was found to exist at the .05 level in internalization of locus of control. These findings tend to support the contention that a simulation game format is a viable remediation tool when used with mildly handicapped adolescents. Further, these findings support past research findings with both disabled and nondisabled participants.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on code-switching in a Dungeons and Dragons tabletop role-playing group. The study focuses on the reasons for code-switching, how code-switching is used as a resource in tabletop role-playing games as well as the participants’ perceived attitudes towards it. The position of English as a lingua franca has changed during past decades and the language has grown to be much more than a traditional lingua franca. In addition to being spoken between non-native speakers of English who do not share a language, it is also used in interactions between non-native speakers who share a native tongue. One of the contexts where this happens is tabletop role-playing games. The tabletop role-playing community has seen a large growth in members during recent years and the popularity of the hobby is continuously on the rise. The gaming community is widely international, and a lot of content is only available in English. This research discusses the code-switching habits of a six-person role-playing group where all the participants’ native language is Finnish. The groups language of play is English.  This study is an ethnographic qualitative study that uses four different data collection methods: audio recordings, observation and fieldnotes, interviews and a questionnaire. The materials for the study are 10.5 hours of audio recordings (6.5h + 3.5h), fieldnotes, a four-question structured interview, and an online language background questionnaire. The audio data was analysed using applied conversation analysis and Goffman’s participant framework while the interviews were analysed using applied thematic analysis. During the analysis of the audio the data was divided into four sub-sections: word searches, cultural references, asymmetry of knowledge, and out of game talk.  The findings show that code-switching was used in a multitude of situations and for a variety of reasons. The most prominent ones being word search and shifting the participant framework. In cases of word search, code-switching was utilised to sustain the flow of the narrative as well as to maintain immersion in the world of the game. In cases where code-switching was used to shift the participant framework, it broke the immersion and signalled that the conversation was no longer happening inside the game world. Code-switching and shifting the participant framework made the conversation move to the foreground and take over the existing mainline. In this context, code-switching was also used as a tool of authority. In addition, in the data code-switching was used as a tool of emphasis and creativity. Different cases of code-switching pointed towards English being the language of the world of fantasy while Finnish was the language of the outside world. It was also found that code-switching was always accompanied by a change in style, tempo or volume. To get more in-depth knowledge about the indexes of code-switching in the contexts of tabletop role-playing games, further study is needed.},

Während in Computerrollenspielen Avatare durch CGI-Umgebungen gesteuert werden, vollzieht sich die Handlung hier durch Beschreibung und ein Improvisationstheater-ähnliches Darstellen. Die diegetischen Wirklichkeiten sind dabei nicht nur inspiriert von verschiedensten Medien, Genres, und Epochen – sei es der »Herr der Ringe« oder die Heian-Zeit (794 – 1185) – sondern stehen in einem Spannungsverhältnis zu Praktiken und Kategorien, die entscheidend für die Herstellung und Aufrechterhaltung der ›normalen‹ Realität außerhalb des Spiels sind. Geschlecht und die Unterscheidung in Mann und Frau gehören zu derartigen Kategorien und damit verbundenen Praktiken. Wie verhält sich das doing gender am Spieltisch zu Geschlechterkategorien und -handlungen außerhalb des Spiels? Ist eine solche Trennung überhaupt möglich und sinnvoll ? Mit Fokus auf Tischrollenspiele in Japan und basierend auf der Analyse von qualitativen Interviews und teilnehmender Beobachtung untersucht der vorliegende Beitrag Geschlecht als ›beiläufige Realität‹ (collateral reality), die in teilweise verbundenen, alltäglichen und spielerischen Kontexten ›getan‹ wird. Das Cross-Gender-Spiel von Rollenspielerinnen und -spielern eröffnet Einblicke in die Stabilisierung von Geschlechtergrenzen – beispielsweise durch geschlechtskonnotierte Sprache, die außerhalb des Spiels als überholt gelten mag, im Spiel jedoch Authentizität schafft – und macht dabei deutlich, dass keine singuläre Größe wie ›die japanische Gesellschaft‹ als Explanans fungieren kann, sondern dass Geschlecht in einem vernetzten und interdependenten Wechselverhältnis von Spiel und Wirklichkeit produziert wird.},

  abstract = {Live-action role-play (larp) has been named a “new performative art,” an immersive experience, and an educational tool, but it is much more: A playground of intermingling social and cultural realities, a door to new worlds. This paper offers an introduction to larp, its transcultural history, and its disruptive and creative possibilities, as well as key aspects, such as immersion. It sets the theoretical frame for the game “Staying Alive,” in which the researchers and also the audience engage in a shared “mimetic evocation of ‘real-life experience.’” Many aspects of “everydayness” can be called “collateral realities,” realities that are done implicitly, unintentionally, such as nations, cultures, time, or distinctions of subject and object, or of presenter and audience; realities that could be different. Taking performativity seriously, larp can be a tool to step outside of a Euro-American commonsense ontology and its singular reality “out there” by playing with collateral realities and making their production explicit. During a larp, players (“larpers”) consciously undo objects and meanings, space, and even their very bodies to creatively weave new material-semiotic fabrics. They become cultural mediators between a world-that-supposedly-just-is and its partially connected others, in which Japaneseness or Chineseness may fade and Elvishness is translated into a reality. With a global player base, larping is not only a practice of intersubjective or cultural negotiations but also of intra-subjective mediation of cultural realities.},

  abstract = {Background. The history of larp, live-action role-play, in Japan may be rather short but documents exponential growth in the entertainment sector as well as in educational gaming. Following trends of related forms of analog role-playing games, the horror genre functions as a motor of increasing popularity., Aim. This article explores the development of non-digital role-playing games in the Japanese context in light of the online video platform niconico popularizing horror role-playing and practical considerations of adopting the genre to live-action play., Method. Cyberethnographic fieldwork including participant observation at larps between 2015 and 2018 forms the data basis for this article, followed by qualitative interviews with larp organizers, larp writers, and designers of analog games as well as observations online in respective webforums., Results. Replays, novelized transcripts of play sessions, have been an entry point into analog role-playing in Japan since the 1980s. With the advent of video sharing sites, replays moved from the book to audio-visual records and a focus on horror games. Creating a fertile ground for this genre, the first indigenous Japanese larp rulebook built on this interest and the ease of access, namely that players do not need elaborate costumes or equipment to participate in modern horror., Discussion. The dominant form of larps in Japan are one-room games, that work well with horror mysteries and function as a low threshold of accessibility. Furthermore, the emotional impact of horror larps, the affective interaction between players and their characters, allows for memorable experiences and so continues to draw in new players and organizers.},

  abstract = {The present dissertation is an attempt at systematically describing the etymologies of archetypal English and Polish fantasy character class terms. It is a historical-comparative as well as contrastive study, in which terms referring to archetypal character classes present in fantasy creations are recognized, classified and investigated with regard to their etymologies, and English-Polish equivalents are juxtaposed to assess their semantic relatedness. The material basis consists of lexemes excerpted from 11 famous and influential fantasy games, including tabletop role-playing games, video games and a board game set in exomimetic fantasy universes. Character classes present in more than two of these sources were deemed archetypal, resulting in 28 English and 33 Polish archetypal character class terms which are divided into three categories based on the Trio trope, a trope frequently found in fiction and especially present in fantasy genre and in PRGs. The categories are: spellcaster characters, further divided into primary and secondary spellcaster characters; fighter characters; and rogue characters. The lexemes are arranged into pairs (or threes or more) of Polish-English equivalents denoting the same character class concept; these are compared in terms of their etymology and semantic relatedness. Subsequently, lexemes belonging to each category are assessed in terms of their origin and original semantic concept lying at their base. The dissertation is divided into three main chapters: the first chapter functions as an introduction and a theoretical basis for the study, outlining the main assumptions of etymological and historical-comparative studies, as well as characterising fantasy as a genre. Furthermore, the results of a short verifying questionnaire are presented, which was carried out to assess whether character class terms are in fact considered characteristic of fantasy genre by the wider public, which they are. The questionnaire also supplied other words connected with fantasy which might be interesting to investigate for the purpose of a potential future Etymological Dictionary of Fantasy Vocabulary. The second, methodological chapter, describes the corpus, the methods used and the structure of the entries for each lexeme’s etymology. Together they form the theoretical basis for the third, analytical chapter in which etymologies of the character class terms are presented, compared and contrasted. The analysis showed that not all of the investigated lexemes have exact semantic equivalents in either Polish or English and that translating some of the lexemes is not free of predicaments. There are some lexemes which have more than one equivalent in either Polish or English and it is not entirely clear which one is semantically closer to the one it is supposed to translate. The primary spellcasters category is especially problematic in terms of inconsistency in translating these character class terms into Polish, what proved to be widespread not only among the investigated sources, but also in fantasy novels and in dictionaries. There also seems to be little semantic differentiation among primary spellcaster characters, making them largely synonymous and differences between them challenging to grasp. Additionally, some of the investigated terms display very different meanings when used in the context of fantasy creations and when used in other contexts.},

It presents a detailed and empirically grounded exploration of tabletop game hobbyists’ online practices that extend the leisure experience beyond playing. The data (N = 190) was collected with a mixed-method online survey, and responses of six open-ended questions were subsequently analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Theoretical frameworks from leisure, consumer culture, game, and media studies informed the analysis. The results are discussed through three broad themes, (1) curating the personal world, (2) situating the self in the social world, and (3) engagement through everyday creativity. The study suggests that online practices allow deeper engagement with tabletop gaming through identity (re)construction. In conclusion, the contributions to literature, practitioners, and society are discussed.},

  abstract = {The study of imaginative play has historically been limited to children, however recent research suggests that adults engage in pretend play far more than previously considered. Though the manner in which adults engage in such play is notably different from children, and has been termed “Pretensive Shared Reality” (PSR). A central question regarding PSR is that of the degree to which the ‘cognitive quarantine’ (Nichols and Stich, 2000) is permeable. We examine the degree of permeability between real and fictive identities, and establish a novel ‘cognitive porousness’ scale. We also established the degree to which theoretically relevant factors, such as enjoyment and engagement, influence porousness. We report that there is a notable degree of cognitive porousness between players' personal identities and their characters’ identity when players responded, via their character, to fantasy-theme moral dilemmas. Furthermore, we found that engagement influenced the degree of permeation while enjoyment appeared to have no impact. This research demonstrates the tractability of examining adult pretence from a quantitative and cognitive perspective.},

  abstract = {Imaginative pretend play is often thought of as the domain of young children, yet adults regularly engage in elaborated, fantastical, social-mediated pretend play. We describe imaginative play in adults via the term “pretensive shared reality;” Shared Pretensive Reality describes the ability of a group of individuals to employ a range of higher-order cognitive functions to explicitly and implicitly share representations of a bounded fictional reality in predictable and coherent ways, such that this constructed reality may be explored and invented/embellished with shared intentionality in an ad hoc manner. Pretensive Shared Reality facilitates multiple individual and social outcomes, including generating personal and group-level enjoyment or mirth, the creation or maintenance of social groups, or the safe exploration of individual self-concepts (such as alternative expression of a players sexual or gender identity). Importantly, Pretensive Shared Reality (both within the specific context of table-top role-playing games, and other instances) are primarily co-operative and co-creative. We draw on multiple examples, and focus on Table-Top Role Playing games (TTRPG) – and specifically, the most popular and enduring table-top role-playing games, Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) – as a primary example of such play. Our conception of “pretensive shared reality” links the widespread existence and forms of adult imaginative play to childhood pretense, places it within a developmental and evolutionary context, and argues that pretensive shared realities – which underpin many forms of imaginative culture – are an important topic of study unto themselves, and may be utilized to provide methodological insight into a variety of psychological domains.},

La question que pose cette thèse est celle des efforts, des activités ou des " travaux " que doit effectuer le joueur de jeux de rôles grandeur nature quand il veut s'immerger dans un univers fictionnel. Cette activité ludique demande l'adoption d'une posture d'engagement dont le trait principal est qu'elle fonctionne sur un mode collaboratif. Sollicitant les cadres théoriques d'Howard Becker (approche par mondes et division du travail créatif), de Jean-Marie Schaeffer (dispositifs d'immersion fictionnelle), de Laurent Thévenot et de Nicolas Auray (régimes d'engagement), j'examine trois de ces efforts, essentiellement grâce à une ethnographie poussée. Le premier effort consiste à accéder à l'univers en créant un personnage actif et autonome ; le second revient à interagir au sein du monde fictionnel dans un double mouvement qui consiste à repousser ses cadres tout en les renforçant ; le troisième implique d'imaginer des modes d'organisation pour donner un cadre à l'action.},

Nous proposons ici une étude de cas d’une pratique à la croisée du jeu de rôle enfantin spontané et du jeu de rôle grandeur nature pour adulte. Menée sous la forme d’un stage estival, cette activité nous permet de comprendre comment adultes et enfants peuvent ponctuellement participer ensemble à l’écriture d’un récit qui prendra la forme d’un jeu en actes et en paroles. Une des caractéristiques principales de cette forme hybride est que l’enfant est placé dans une position d’auteur, d’acteur et de spectateur. Mais contrairement à ses propres jeux, il est en permanence sous la surveillance et la conduite d’adultes qui supervisent le développement du récit et la conformité des actions par rapport aux règles. Le jeune joueur est donc dans une posture originale~: il produit une partie du contenu narratif du jeu dont il n’est pas l’acteur unique (en créant par exemple son personnage). Lui aussi veut raconter une histoire, mettre en place un scénario, créer des règles et faire jouer les adultes, comme dans son jeu enfantin. Mais les règles changent, il n’est plus omnipotent et doit jouer dans des cadres de simulation qu’il contribue à définir.},

TTRPGs are at their core a deeply social endeavor, fostering social connection among players. TTRPG play, however, can also harbor tensions and conflict, resulting in a negative experience and hindering the overall enjoyment of the game. One of the identified causes of conflict are the feelings of unfairness experienced by players. Our study employed a combination of an on-line questionnaire with 57 responses and the analysis of 528 comments from 3 relevant YouTube videos to explore the multifaceted nature of game master unfairness in TTRPGs from the perspective of the players. The study reveals that GM unfairness is pervasive in the game with 73\% of the responders reporting at least one incident. Its most common forms include controlling and restricting agency, unequal player treatment, favouritism and unbalanced and discriminatory in-game scenarios. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of unfairness in TTRPGs, highlighting the need for supporting GMs to promote more equitable and inclusive gaming environments and proposing concrete suggestions to this end.},

  abstract = {This paper presents two studies on promoting social communication and leisure satisfaction of children and youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through the use of tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). The first study involved four junior high school students with ASD, and focused on "intentional speech directed to other children" and their "consensu-making" during TRPG play sessions. The results of the analysis suggest that intentional speech as well as the ability to reach consensus increased remarkably between the 14th and the 1st session. The second study investigated the efficacy of leisure activity using TRPGs to enhance the quality of life (QOL) of children and youth with ASD. Fifty-five teenagers with high-functioning ASD participated in the study and responded to the standardized "Questionnaire for Measuring Quality of Life" before and after the TRPG activities. After a total of five sessions once a month significant improvement in the total scores and most of subscales of QOL could be observed. The subscales of "emotional well-being" and "friends" in particular, improved remarkably. These findings suggest that leisure activities.},

  abstract = {Critical analysis of Netflix’s hit show Stranger Things has largely emphasized its nostalgic engagement with 1980s Americana, and particularly that decade’s science fiction and horror films. However, trappings of the Gothic in Stranger Things do not merely align it with the twentieth century’s recent past; they also function in ways that demonstrate Stranger Things’ connection to the more distant past of the Romantic period’s Gothic novels. This article extends the Gothic inheritance of Stranger Things beyond 1980s’ science fiction horror to the Romantic Gothic novel’s investment in the found manuscript, the departure point for examining the use of Dungeons \& Dragons in Stranger Things alongside Mary Shelley’s use of found manuscripts in Frankenstein and The Last Man. This article reads the found manuscript as a collaboratively produced parergon (a framing device sitting both inside and outside of the text), which works through acts of translation and recreation to bring the past to bear on the present. Through examining Stranger Things’ conceptual framing of its alternate dimension, the Upside Down, and the monstrous Demogorgon through Dungeons \& Dragons, this article argues that Dungeons \& Dragons functions in Stranger Things as a Gothic found manuscript, drawing literary and Gothic pasts into the show’s present.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the connections between utopian approaches in performance studies, queer strategies for community building, and the world-creation tools made available by tabletop “pen and paper” role-playing games (TRPGs). Particularly, drawing on the varied modes of reality offered by each of the above, and they ways they can support experimentation with alternative societies, relationships, and political ideologies.Beginning with a contextual analysis of Dungeons \& Dragons, it outlines the structure, history, and current iterations of tabletop roleplaying games, towards an understanding of how the form can be used in the construction of playful, microcosmic utopias sensitive to queer experiences of solidarity within marginalisation. To illustrate this usage, Avery Alder’s queer, post-apocalyptic TRPG Dream Askew (2019) is later explored as a particularly appropriate case study to illustrate this usage.The paper goes on to look at how the conception of Utopia as a world apart (as in Thomas Moore’s ‘No Place’), the establishing of a ‘Magic Circle’ (coined by Johan Huizinga) as a zone of shifted possibility in both game and performance contexts, and the genres of science fiction and speculative fiction, can be used together to facilitate a form of collaborative storytelling. This type of storytelling is noted as being politically significant in the ways it consolidates the roles of performer and spectator, engaging with Augusto Boal’s critiques of passive spectatorship, and framing of performance as possible “rehearsal for revolution” [1974(2008): 135].},

Additionally, this study sought to determine what role or roles educators should play in developing the gaming culture of teenage students. In order to answer these questions, seven people who played TRPGs as teenagers were interviewed about their past and current TRPG interests, past and current leisure reading habits, and the effects that playing TRPGs had on their literacy skills. This study revealed that all participants felt that playing TRPGs improved at least one literacy skill and that greater depth and breadth of TRPG experience helped some participants to surmount real or perceived difficulties with reading or speaking; TRPGs also helped participants improve listening skills . In most cases, playing TRPGs also led to a greater quantity of leisure reading. However, TRPGs did not appear to influence which genres participants read; some who previously read fantasy appreciated the connections they saw in TRPGs; yet others did not see TRPGs relating to their reading interests. While some participants saw their schooling and TRPG interests overlap, none saw a need for educators to take an active role in encouraging TRPG gaming among students.},

D\&D and other TTRPGs set themselves apart from other games by allowing for a massive amount of freedom both in character creation and in-game choices, both of which are a massive appeal for the player base. However, this also allows for conflict not only between the players, but also between the characters they create. This project examines 126 cases of player character conflict gathered through a survey. Physical or material harm to player characters perpetrated by another player character, as treatment of non-playable characters (NPCs), and differences in mission plans were common triggers for conflict. Players tended to enjoy conflict more when it resulted in positive outcomes for themselves and their characters. They tended to dislike conflict when it was the result of a repeated issue.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigated how queer folks communicate and perform queerness to build community and to belong. Also under examination was the impact that virtual role-play had on these queer rhetorical and communication practices. I asked three research questions within this dissertation: How is queerness communicated and performed in virtual Dungeons \& Dragons games? How do queer folks use or alter the space of virtual Dungeons \& Dragons games? How do queer folks co-construct community and belonging in virtual Dungeons \& Dragons games? To address these questions, I conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with participants who identified as queer and/or LGBTQIA+ and had experience playing virtual Dungeons \& Dragons games. I used thematic analysis and theoretical concepts from queer theory and Gloria Anzaldúa to analyze the interview data. Through this analysis, I identified several themes for each research question. This study found that participants communicate queerness by subverting the normative, viewing queerness as the default, and showing agency. Participants perform queerness through embodied metaphors and by trialing aspects of identity. Participants in this study use virtual space to gain access to other queer folks, to provide safety, and to seize opportunities for queer community engagement and representation. To co-construct community and belonging, queer folks use queer worldbuilding, maintain a patient and invitational attitude, and support systemic change within the tabletop role-playing game system. The Anzaldúan concepts of Borderlands, hacienda caras, nepantla, nepantleras, and la facultad were useful in the interpretation of the findings.},

We can then use Genetic Algorithms to create the characters required by those stories. Through user interaction, we can dictate what kind of characters and stories should be created and the computer slowly converges to creating stories according to the users liking. With the implementation of this methodology, we can ensure that no two plays of the same game should give the user the same experience. With user input we can ensure that the Genetic Algorithm learns with every play-through thus creating stories and characters that are more according to the liking of the user.},

Although a number of experiential strategies have been introduced but still didactic styles of delivering material is still in use. It provides an efficient delivery style but it does not promote critical thinking. Experiential approaches used in nursing education include role play, simulation, laboratory projects. Role play has a competitive element that does not exist in didactic lecturing, simulations or practical exercises. Methods: This paper will focus the use of a role play as a teaching strategy to support classroom learning in the health sciences nursing education .It will also discuss the literature related to role play and our experiences of using the role play as a teaching learning strategy Results: The nursing literature highlights many reasons for using role play as a teaching strategy, including the promotion of active learning, encouragement for critical thinking, the value of fun and excitement in learning, and replication of real-life situations. The use of games generally enhances student enjoyment and may improve long-term retention of information Conclusions: The use of Role Play Games, can promote the development of users’ creativity, autonomy, responsibility and other decision related skills. The use of these games for learning is an immediate consequence of the need to put learners in a context where they must develop their knowledge in an effective way},

For the empirical investigations, the study embraced an ethnographic approach through participatory observations, complimented by analysis of scripts and interviews with writers. The study then used the findings from the empirical investigations to understand what make players feel more embodied during an online LARPing and let the results inform the creation of design guidelines that could bring a higher degree of embodiment to online LARPing. The work is mainly a design proposal or a design guidance intended for future online LARP designers, instead of building a new technology or a new prototype. The design guidelines aim to create comprehensive recommendations to bring out more embodiment while LARPing online.},

  abstract = {During the medieval and early modern periods, folkloric goblins were often presented as multifaceted creatures with unclear origins and as nebulous markers of the preternatural. Beginning in the 1800s, however, authors crafted new interpretations of these creatures that appropriated folkloric traditions to create a distinct kind of fictional goblin. The works of George MacDonald (d. 1905) and J. R. R. Tolkien (d. 1973) were essential to this process. MacDonald’s The Princess and the Goblin (1872) fuses folklore with Darwinian evolutionary thought to present goblins as antagonistic, troglodytic schemers who devolved from humans. MacDonald’s ideas were influential on Tolkien, as he characterizes goblins as a corrupted and evil ‘race’—descriptions that utilize racialized language common in early twentieth-century England. Tolkien and MacDonald thus flattened folkloric goblins in their own works such that they became an entirely different (and specific) kind of fictional monster that reflected contemporary trends in English society.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims to create narrative structures and experiences for Māori who are disconnected from their culture to reforge that connection to their heritage through playing TTRPGs (Tabletop Roleplaying Games). Research on the modern Māori way of life and identity, as well as analysis of the current political landscape Māori live within in Aotearoa and the world will be a primary focus of this thesis and creative output. The many ways Māori identify in Aotearoa are and will continue to change. The ability to navigate those changes to seek and find belonging through the playing of TTRPGs is the main aim of this thesis. There are many types of TTRPGs, the emergent narratives of imaginative and collaborative storytelling create meaningful moments for players to live out scenarios they may not be able to in real life. The creative output of this thesis is a game that aims to create moments for Māori who identify on across the spectrum of connection to their culture to play out moments in their fictional character’s life, giving them agency in a fictional world where in the real world they may have none. The imagined moments shared in these stories live on in the minds of their players and affect them in meaningful ways throughout their lives. Qualitative research was gathered that highlighted the many identities of Māori across a spectrum of connection. Interviews and playthroughs conducted following the Kaupapa Kōrero conversation methodology guide the research. This thesis emulates through gameplay the conversations Māori have in their journey to reconnect to their culture. This thesis concludes that TTRPGs are an invaluable tool to help navigate the conversations one has when reconnecting with one’s culture.},

  abstract = {Schneider (2023) suggests that tabletop roleplaying games (TRPGs) offer a platform for learners to practice diverse social and communicative strategies without real-world consequences. This paper aims to explore the integration of TRPGs, connected to multiliteracy pedagogy, into lifelong language learning and its potential benefits. Utilizing a phenomenological framework involving dialogues, interviews, and reflections, the study engages participants—lifelong English learners and native speakers from various backgrounds, all with over 20 years of TRPG experience. The project encompasses two aspects: first, it delves into the experiences of L2 English learners and non-native English educators who employ TRPGs to enhance their speaking skills. Second, it investigates the role of game leaders in guiding L2 players through problem-solving scenarios and culturally relevant knowledge, thus promoting skills beyond language acquisition. An additional micro experiment involving educators as novice players yields thematic parallels to seasoned gamers’ experiences. By applying phenomenology, this research addresses two key questions: 1. How does TRPG participation enhance motivation, autonomy, and fluency for lifelong language learners? 2. How does TRPG involvement contribute to the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among language learners (LL) and second language (L2) learners? The outcomes will inform discussions and offer recommendations for learners seeking to improve these facets of language learning.},

  abstract = {A theatre creation, even the most minimalistic or humble, holds many elements, depends on many people and is easy to mess up by one person not being there at the right moment. That naturally implies a strict discipline and hierarchy. Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game with a giant book of rules, a mathematical calculation element and a Dungeon Master, a person who literally creates the game world. Nevertheless, while players are advancing in the game with the storytelling, character development, acting, improvisation and analysis they are also being entertained in friendly atmosphere. In many cases a good game session is not only a powerful creative tool and a bonding social activity but in many ways it also works as therapy, helping people to get through life with depression, anxiety and trauma. I think there's something we can learn from the game and bring this knowledge to the theatre.},

The chapter focuses on business RPGs as a form of treating the economy as role-play. It explores the economics of RPGs: their market size, business models, and the like and the economies within RPGs (e.g., their markets, auction houses, and interchanges with the real economy). While games and role-play have a long tradition of being used in business simulation and training, RPGs and role-playing themselves have not been the object of much economic attention.},

The malleability of this world, coupled with the RPGs' social aspect, parallels the socially constructed reality which usually surrounds us. In this paper I collect a series of impressions from a few roleplaying sessions during which different groups of players attempted to construct new realities. In this sense, I examine the shared creation of reality out of empty space, exploring the potential inherent in roleplaying as a metaphor for organizing. I look for non-standard view-points on organizing which emerge from these sessions, and examine the process itself, not trying to pinpoint any regularities, but rather seeking the unusual and the sublime.},

  abstract = {\emph{Ultima and Worldbuilding in the Computer Role-Playing Game} is the first scholarly book to focus exclusively on the long-running \emph{Ultima} series of computer role-playing games (RPG) and to assess its lasting impact on the RPG genre and video game industry. Through archival and popular media sources, examinations of fan communities, and the game itself, this book historicizes the games and their authors. By attending to the salient moments and sites of game creation throughout the series’ storied past, authors Carly A. Kocurek and Matthew Thomas Payne detail the creative choices and structural forces that brought \emph{Ultima}’s celebrated brand of role-playing to fruition. This book first considers the contributions of series founder and lead designer, Richard Garriott, examining how his fame and notoriety as a pioneering computer game auteur shaped \emph{Ultima}’s reception and paved the way for the evolution of the series. Next, the authors retrace the steps that Garriott took in fusing analog, tabletop role-playing with his self-taught lessons in computer programming. Close textual analyses of \emph{Ultima I} outline how its gameplay elements offered a foundational framework for subsequent innovations in design and storytelling. Moving beyond the game itself, the authors assess how marketing materials and physical collectibles amplified its immersive hold and how the series’ legions of fans have preserved the series. Game designers, long-time gamers, and fans will enjoy digging into the games’ production history and mechanics while media studies and game scholars will find \emph{Ultima and Worldbuilding in the Computer Role-Playing Game} a useful extension of inquiry into authorship, media history, and the role of fantasy in computer games design.  \textbf{Carly A.

  abstract = {The present dissertation aims at contributing to the Systemic Functional Description of Brazilian Portuguese (HALLIDAY \& MATTHIESSEN, 2014; FIGUEREDO, 2011), more specifically, to the description of register (MARTIN \& ROSE, 2007). It also aims at contributing to the field of the Multilingual Studies (MATTHIESSEN et al., 2008; FIGUEREDO 2011) and to the growing field of RPG studies (SCHMIT, 2008). It presents a systemic functional description of a register localized on the intersection of the socio-semiotic processes exploring:arguing \& expounding:explaining (argumentative text) according to its field, tenor and mode constitution (HALLIDAY \& MATTHIESSEN, 2014; MARTIN \& ROSE, 2007) and placed on the context of situation of Tabletop Role Playing Game (or RPG). As a co-participatory narrative construction, the RPG stands as a macrotext built by a series of types of texts among which the argumentation takes an important part (FUJII, 2010). Nonetheless, previous research evidences significant weakness in de capacity of developing argumentation, mainly by children and adolescents (KUHN \& UDELL, 2003). At the same time, previous research identifies that the studies of RPG lack in developing work regarding the textual potential of the game as a tool for pedagogical purposes. In the intersection of these demands, we can find the problem to be solve by the present research: how can systemic functional description of the register “argumentative text” help understand the constitution and functioning of the RPG, as well as it’s potentiality as a tool for de development of argumentative skills by the participants immersed in the game. In order to accomplish the objective of describing the argumentative text according to its grammatical constitution, a corpus of RPG sessions was collected and submitted to first analysis, using the concepts of FIELD, TENOR and MODE, so that argumentation could be evidenced. Then, the register was systemically profiled according to its TRANSITIVITY, MOOD AND THEME constitution (HALLIDAY \& MATTHIESSEN, 2014; FIGUEREDO, 2011). The frequency of occurrence of each function was analyzed in order to understand how grammar organizes and produces argumentative meaning in the register. The results of the present research show how the argumentative text is constituted and organized, as well as how participants use the system networks in order to produce and develop the argumentative text.},

  abstract = {From a young age, children are exposed to societal standards of gender and gender roles and, by extension, inherent sex-based biases, which can become inculcated into their worldview. These biases affect their daily lives negatively in ways that can seem almost natural unless specifically pointed out. Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPGs) are pen-and-paper games that revolve around collaborative storytelling in a shared, collectively imagined and built world, usually involving 2 to 5 players. TTRPGs provide a safe, controlled environment to mimic social interactions in a way that video games and other forms of media cannot. This paper introduces a new TTRPG, New Age Mages, aimed at a younger audience, with the goal of introducing the concept of biases and helping them to see things from a different perspective. In New Age Mages, players interact with a world where magic is commonplace as students that have recently unlocked their magic, while a Game Master (GM) narrates the world as determined by the players’ choices. The game’s magic system allows it to mimic the influence and/or impact of modern-day gender roles and biases without referring to them directly while remaining simple and easy to learn for a new player. The game also aims to subtly incentivise the Players to make decisions that would be different from what they might usually make, and promote trying to understand the others’ points of view. We believe this game will be useful for those seeking to help children gain a better understanding of gender roles and their subversion. We use a questionnaire based on the Gender Role Attitudes Scale (GRAS) to measure the impact gameplay has on players’ ideas of gender roles. We also test the game with some initial gameplay experiments among a smaller audience that is more familiar with TTRPGs and present the results. Our work explores not only the ability of TTRPGs to influence perspectives and opinions, but also doing so specifically in the space of understanding gender roles among a younger audience.},

  abstract = {This article presents the Wunderkammer-Gesamtkunstwerk (Wu-Ge) Model as a framework for the analysis and design of role-playing games. This framework is divided into four parts: Sub-Creation, Ludus, Performance, and Narrative. Sub-Creation is the world-building of the role-playing game. Ludus is the game mechanics and play rules. Performance is how the role-playing game is performed by the players. And Narrative is the storyline of the role-playing game. The model seeks to connect rather than tear these four parts and does this by the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk which means that indeed all the parts should work together as a whole work of art. Another concept is the Wunderkammer which means cabinet of curiosities. In this context the role-playing game is seen as a Wunderkammer and every item, concept, or idea put into this Wunderkammer is somehow changed by the relation to the other curiosities of the Wunderkammer. Furthermore, the Wu-Ge Model presents a structure based on two dichotomies: Concrete vs. Abstract and Action vs. Contemplation. Performance and Narrative belong to the Concrete, while Ludus and Sub-Creation belong to the Abstract. Performance and Ludus belong to Action, while Sub-Creation and Narrative belong to Contemplation. This means that the role-playing game wavers between the abstract and the concrete and between active and contemplative states. The aim of the article is to show how this knowledge can be used to not only analyse role-playing games but use it as a way to design role-playing games as well. The Wu-Ge Model helps define role-playing games and understand how they work as Wunderkammer and Gesamtkunstwerk.},

  abstract = {Gaming capital: a fifteen-year-old theory detailing how one’s gaming knowledge can be conceptualized into something tangible. In her book Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Video Games, Consalvo (2007) presented the term gaming capital to give a name and meaning to the collective understanding of both the individual player and the communities that entail the discussions about the game, genre, or the platform – including topics like knowledge, experience, and skill. Yet, there has not been much scholarly attention given to where one would situate gaming capital between cultural and symbolic capital, and where social capital would influence the transformation of knowledge to gaming capital. The discussion about gaming capital has been more about what it is, and what can be or cannot be gaming capital, but what steers gaming capital as an entity at their disposal has not been studied enough yet. The world of gaming has moved massively forwards in fifteen years, and the whole concept of what “gaming” is has subsequently changed, not only within the online multiplayer video game scene, but within analogue role-playing games too. Both mediums have their ways of accumulating and spending capital, and not everything is different in terms of gaming capital. Therefore, this study approaches the formation of gaming capital within both Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) and Dungeons \&amp; Dragons (1974) through information flow and social space perspectives.},

  abstract = {This study uses corpus-assisted discourse analysis for a case study of how some game masters (GMs) use address to participate in the construction of player-character identities in the linguistic setting of a tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG). Discourse analysis has been used to study TRPG gameplay before (White, 2011), but it has been rare and in the past decade, the proliferation of TRPG content online featuring gameplay (often called actual-play content) has enabled the use of much larger datasets than before. These datasets in turn enable corpus-assisted research to take place. The basis of this study is the discourse analytic understanding of identity as being discursively constructed, where one not only constructs and uses identities, but can also be cast into them by others (Antaki, 2013). TRPGs are understood as a linguistic setting in which multiple names are often applicable to the same person; the player’s own name, and the name of the character created for the game. These names refer to different identities, and using one or the other is understood to be an instance of momentary casting into that identity. In addition, a model was adapted from previous roleplaying game (RPG) studies regarding layers of rules and goals (Montola, 2008) into layers of speech in order to understand the structure of discourse around the gaming table. For data, a corpus was collected of transcripts of two popular TRPG actual-play series, and data from different GMs was divided into different subcorpora. The address patterns of seven GMs were studied to compare the choice frequencies of address terms in different speech layers and between different genders of speakers and addressees. This analysis was supplemented by close reading of some data points to analyze the potential factors behind certain address term choices. All GMs included in the study were found to vastly prefer address by character name, though the strength of this preference varies between individuals, with no effect from the gender of the speaker. Speech layers were found to be a major factor in the choice of address terms, and the speech layers themselves were found to vary in prevalence depending on the style and content of the game. Only the middle layer, endogenous speech, was found to be necessary to running the game, but speech in this layer was found to have such varied functions that a more detailed typology may be needed. The different aspects of addressee gender could not be properly isolated as variables, but there are signs warranting further study of possible weakening of the preference for character names when addressing participants with nonbinary characters and characters of a gender different from the player.},

  abstract = {This thesis seeks to demonstrate how "race" as a concept is utilized in the genre of high fantasy. It examines how race is constructed in fantasy texts utilizing an essentialist framework wherein race is determinative of individual morality, psyche, and aptitude. In imagining race in fantastical worlds, high fantasy texts reproduce the ideas of unabashedly white supremacist race philosophers such as Carl Linnaeus, Arthur de Gobineau, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, applying them to fantastical beings rather than real world groups. The same racial logics that informed Nazism are seen at play in The Lord of the Rings, Dungeons and Dragons, and World of Warcraft. This thesis will examine how the essentialist framework is utilized through the three most common racial groups in high fantasy: Dwarves, Orcs, and Elves. In examining each of these groups in turn, broad patterns of how race is imagined become clear. Stereotypes about real-world groups are imported into fantastical worlds, where they are often combined and remixed over time by successive waves of authors. In comparing different fantasy texts, we see how the characterization of particular races changes with time to reflect the culture of the eras that produce them. In some cases, these re-imaginings are done directly in opposition to previous texts in attempts to correct offensive caricatures. However, even as imagined races themselves have changed with time, the overall concept of ?race? in high fantasy remains mired in an essentialist mindset.},

The Project System does not give fast and easy answers but leads participants to find them on their own. For 30 hours, participants find themselves within a larp, which is a very intense type of role-playing game based on human interactions. The author has chosen a larp as a medium as one of the most immersive and influential method of game-based learning which can facilitate topics that are normally hard to explain through conventional methods of learning. Participants learn firsthand through their roles, emotions, story and experience. Findings - Project System was a really strong and important experience for many players that may have partially changed their lives. After more than 500 players walked through it, the author can say that this method is beneficial. Originality/value - Larp as an educational tool is used all over the world; however, there are still only few professional organizations. Most of them are focused on using larp (or similar role-playing methods) as a tool at elementary or secondary schools. Using larp in andragogy is currently pioneering.},

In recent years there is a growing interest whether this type of Internet use, represents an "addiction". We recruited 22 former players (14 players of Internet and 8 players of pen and paper Role Playing Games - RPGs; mean age 27 +/- 5years who had succeeded to cut back the game without external help. We tried to describe players' perceptions of their previous "addiction" and compare their views. The study data was collected through personal interviews. Semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed and subjected to qualitative content analysis. Based on the results, the players' expressed various perceptions, which constituted five categories: games' particular characteristics, negative effects and positive effects on players' lives, possible causes for their behavior, and future intentions. Significant differences were noted in players' perceptions between the two groups. For Internet users content analysis revealed the same basic problems: irritability, social life neglect, and disruption of relationships, sleep deprivation, school or university failure, and loss of interest in other activities. Younger players reported even more problems. Overall, Internet players attributed their problems to an "addictive dynamic". None of these problems existed in players of pen and paper RPGs. Those players reported feelings of satisfaction, pleasure, improved social interactions and friendship connected to the game. Four players who were adolescents, all former Internet players, characterized their previous Internet use as an "addiction". They were seeing their problems as more serious and disruptive for their lives. In conclusion, the majority of internet players recognize the "addictive dynamic" of the game, but they do not necessarily consider themselves as "addicted". They characterize their Internet use and its consequences as a "choice"; time loss and difficulty breaking off from the game were the more serious problems faced mainly by Internet players. It should be noted, however, that in contrast to clearly "addicted players", the players of this study were all able to overcome their psychological and behavioral problems without any external help after successful cessation of the Internet use.},

In the experiments, GPT-3, a popular pre-trained language model from OpenAI, was leveraged, but it is possible to extend the approach to any other generative LLM. We evaluate, how different types of context in the prompt influence the query generation performance on QALD-9, QALD-10 and Bestiary dataset (BESTIARY), which was created to test LLM performance on unseen data, and provide a detailed error analysis. One of the findings is that providing the model with the underlying KG and a random correct query improve the generation results. The approach shows strong results on QALD-9 dataset, but doesn’t generalize on QALD-10 and BESTIARY, which can be caused by memorization problem.},

  abstract = {Identity theory argues that the self (i.e., viewing oneself from the standpoint of others) is composed of multiple identities, or internalized positional designations. Salience, or the probability of an identity being invoked in a given situation, is argued to have two causes, interactional commitment (embeddedness in an identity-related network) and affective commitment (emotional gratification derived from an identity), and to in turn result in identity-related behavior. This dissertation addresses three limitations of past research: the neglect of leisure identities, the operationalization of behavior as time spent in role rather than as specific types of behavior, and the failure to include all four identity theory concepts in a single study. Data were collected in July 1983 for 113 boys (aged 10 to 17) attending a camp devoted to Dungeons and Dragons gaming. Campers completed surveys administered each of the five days of camp. Factor analyses established scales of each concept, while path analyses determined the relationships among the concepts. The results indicate the importance of delineating among types of behavior; interactional commitment consistently affects social behaviors, while affective commitment consistently affects solitary behaviors. Both types of commitment affect materialistic behavior. Dividing the sample on such variables as age and the length of time one had been gaming indicates that involvement with social behavior occurs the longer one has been gaming; this can be seen as support for one's ability and inclination to role-make, the search for self-validation, and development within identities. Contrary to the theory, interactional commitment is seldom related to salience, and salience rarely affects behavior. Identity theorists studying adolescents are urged to consider the possibility that the salience hierarchy of teens and pre-teens may be so unstable or ill-formed that weak or anomalous findings with regard to salience may result.},

This allowed for the investigation of the evaluative language of five individuals with ABI. The analysis revealed that individuals were capable of using various resources of appraisal to communicate their identities and did so differently across contexts. SFL, specifically the analysis of appraisal, is a useful resource for examining the communication and negotiation of identity after ABI.

But play practices directed toward the expressive creation of story seem to challenge a games-centric understanding of narrative play. Consequently, we propose that some interactive narrative systems can be better understood as a different form of playable media: narrative instruments, analogous to musical instruments in their provision of support for authorship-oriented forms of play.},

One of the core failings of Dungeons \& Dragons’ Fifth edition, according to users, is slow and disengaging combat. It is my belief that digital tools can be added to Dungeons \& Dragons in such a way that their implementation does not limit physical gameplay while providing a variety of new tools to players. This paper proposes a tool that can avoid these pitfalls while improving combat and gameplay flow.},

  abstract = {The 4th Category is a major update on Rob Kuntz's seminal treatise Dave Arneson's True Genius, as well as a preview to his upcoming research opus, A New Ethos in Game Design. This ground-breaking study which identifies D\&D's true origins includes historical matter concerning the rise of classic D\&D from its pre-LGTSA state under Dave Arneson, to the LGTSA play-tests, to its publication in 1974 and immediate post-publication phase from 1974-75. After Arneson emphatically captured Gary’s and the LGTSA's attention with his Blackmoor demo game, it was our turn to fully experience this new system. Several weeks into the new play-tests of the game system Gary, post-game, made an observation that I’ve previously referred to in the preface and is worth noting again: “We’ve created a fourth category in games.” He said this while looking at an indistinct spot in the dining room. He then went on to list the three categories of games that existed at the time… Table-Top Games… Parlor Games… Physical and Outdoor Activity Games… — excerpted from the Introduction to A New Ethos in Game Design. This work describes how Rob Kuntz went on to corroborate Gary Gygax’s monumental assertion. In it he presents the following proofs gleaned from his 16 years of studies and research:     The new system's qualities are meticulously explained     Its unique system architecture is revealed and its operations are explained in detail     Alongside this, Rob asserts that with D\&D's original publication, a breakout medium in storytelling — real time story crafting — was created, which corresponds in major ways to traditional oral storytelling.},

EC has been found to be related to various constructs across different fields of psychology during the past 30 years, but a comprehensive examination of previous research is still lacking. The goal of this review is to explore the reliability of use of the Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI) across studies, to test gender differences and to compare levels of EC in different countries. Thirty-five empirical studies focused on EC were retrieved and the coefficients required for the meta-analysis extracted. The meta-analysis revealed that women showed significantly higher EC than men (total N = 3,555). The same gender differences were also found when testing scores from three ECI subscales, i.e. emotional novelty, emotional preparedness and emotional effectiveness/authenticity. When comparing EC in 10 different countries (total N = 4,375), several cross-cultural differences were revealed. The Chinese sample showed a significantly lower average ECI total score than all the other countries. Based on the integration of results, the avenues for future research on EC and the breadth of influence of the concept of EC across different fields of psychology are discussed.},

  abstract = {Immersive storytelling (IST) is usually conceptualized within the framework of technologically immersive tools such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. While these tools offer some unique features (such as visual fidelity, interactivity, and embodied, first-person perspective), their level of technological immersion (based on the system’s objective qualities) might not directly translate to the psychological immersion experienced by the user. Such tools also tend to require access to digital or financial resources unavailable to many schools. We propose a low-tech alternative approach leveraging storytelling’s power for learning through affordable, accessible, and familiar classroom technology – Google Slides. We used the Participatory Learning framework to generate curricular design principles that aim to create a sense of psychological immersion through active participation in technology-mediated storytelling. In this design case study paper, we describe the design of a 10-day unit on Native American history implemented across nine teachers’ elementary school classrooms in the US. We examine the interplay between pedagogical and technological constraints in the design process, the role of the theoretical framework in the design, and conclude by detailing future directions for research on low-tech immersive storytelling environments.},

  abstract = {Role-Playing Games (RPGs) are a popular game genre with roots in the first edition of Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) in 1974 (Appelcline, 2014; Hitchens \& Drachen, 2009), having a tabletop form. Since then, Tabletop RPGs (TRPGs) have been applied in various settings, such as fantasy, horror, sci-fi, western, spy, historical, military, mixtures of two or more. TRPGs are still very popular, transferring small groups of people within a fantasy world that evolves through players’ verbal descriptions. Their interactive roleplay character brings together the ideas and interests of the participants, providing an immersive social and creative experience that entertains players (White, 2018).TRPGs have been applied in various contexts, such as education, business, military, improvisational theatre, health care, leisure. E.g., CodePlay is a TRPG that improves computer programming and teamwork skills via roleplaying (Ntokos, 2020) while City of Dred is another TRPG about data survivability (Lopes, 2015). From another viewpoint, learners could be engaged within a meaningful experience of making, modifying, and sharing their own games. In this constructionist approach, the game becomes an object-to-think-with (Papert, 1991), and learners coherently form and transform their ideas expressed in particular contexts (Ackermann, 2001). Currently, there is a shift in the direction of game-making for learning, however, there are no results that focus on TRPGs and their influence on learning and motivation.ObjectiveWe argue that the design of TRPGs has the potential to provide a rich learning experience that motivates game makers, while, at the same time, they have the chance to create a fully functional game, practicing all the required steps of the game making process. A medieval stage could be used to place the characters and the game action, motivating game makers in the design process. Imagination, brainstorming, and looking at the literature are combined with decisions regarding the game mechanics and lots of playtesting. Therefore, it is important to identify the effects of this process on learners, especially in motivation and learning aspects. As a result, our research question that we will investigate is formulated below:RQ: Which are the effects of the TRPGs design process on the participants’ motivation and learning?MethodWe performed a pilot study with 16 university students. We introduced participants to the RPGs game genre, having a particular focus on their tabletop form. We familiarized them with the TRPGs gameplay and the required steps of the design process. Then, we asked them to design TRPGs in the context of Corfu’s medieval history. We describe some representative summaries of the produced projects and discuss preliminary findings derived from informal observations and conversations with the students. The findings will be used as a basis for the game-making approach.ConclusionThis study provides evidence on the use of TRPGs as the context which engages participants in a game-making learning process. The creation of the fictional world deeply immersed most participants in the process. They were engaged in the repetitive form of making games which involved designing, evaluating, and improving their designs towards functional tabletop games. Clearly, this field of study displays a number of characteristics that can be highly beneficial for the identification of the motivation and learning mechanisms of this highly immersive game-making process.References1.

Le fait de jouer avec l'Histoire suppose-t-il des précautions particulières ? A-t-on besoin d'une théorie sur l'Histoire pour jouer au jeu de rôle ? Quelles conséquences l'Histoire a-t-elle sur les propositions que l'on peut faire au cours d'une partie ? Quelles distinctions entre jouer l'Histoire, jouer avec l'Histoire et jouer avec des histoires ? Bonne semaine à tous et à toutes ! Portez-vous bien et surtout jouez bien !},

To extend current narrative theory, we introduce narrative agency: the ability to control the development of the story characters and plot, with lasting changes to the narrative world. We first explain how narrative agency stems from spatial embeddedness and character embodiment and then use the three constructs to offer a typology of narrative consumption. We then set an agenda for future research centered on (1) the implications that space and body have for narrative agency, (2) how consumers negotiate interactions and ownership in highly agentic narrative consumption, and (3) the dynamics of return and transformation after highly agentic narrative journeys.},

  abstract = {There are numerous examples of role-playing being adapted and included as a pedagogical technique in teaching, including in higher education. For example, teachers might simulate different scenarios, and role-play different stakeholders and users, in order to create more experiential types of learning environments. Role-playing can also provide an opportunity for students to actively explore, reflect upon and personalise the material that is studied. Similar techniques can be seen in User Experience Design (UXD), where practitioners create personas and scenarios to describe representative and typical users and use-cases. In this report, we propose an alternative use to the more traditional way of using personas and scenarios in academia as well as in industry: as character sheets and role-playing. Instead of being more analytical and descriptive tools in the design process, our role-playing approach invites exploration and personal interaction. Putting such character sheets into action allows the design team to interact with hypothetical, but typical users, thus providing a richer understanding of their context, and facilitating an empathetic understanding of the different stakeholders and their sometimes conflicting interests. This is particularly relevant in an educational context, where students are learning and training to improve as designers.},

  abstract = {Live action role-play (larp) is a recognized form of role-play where players physically embody characters in fictional settings. The medium is immensely versatile and different larp traditions approach the activity and its design in a variety of ways.    The participatory and ephemeral nature of larp makes it a difficult medium to explore without playing. It is, however, relevant to communicate aspects of the activity to external audiences for purposes of posterity and recognition. Larp documentation cannot encapsulate the fleeting artwork, as it lacks a permanent form. As the player is the central audience of larp, we seek to understand the player experience in order to comprehend the relevance of larp. The importance of documentation forces the larp community to explore new ways of capturing the dissipating artworks.    The study explores what can be captured of the ephemeral larp experience, and how it translates to outside audiences. The written part of the study examines characteristics of larp and central challenges for its documentation, as well as the creation of a fictional documentary film. The artistic part of the study is the outcome of an exploration of larp as a platform for creation, resulting in a fictional documentary called “Vielä hetki.”    The study shows that while larp is impossible to document thoroughly, parts of the ephemeral larp experience can be captured. Larp documentation should be approached as a collection of different documents, as no single document or medium can cover the whole larp. The medium can be used as a source for sampling, as larp provides a platform for artistic exploration but only allows parts of its expression to be captured. It is possible to create independent works of art inside larp that external audiences can relate to and to utilize such artworks in translating the exclusive larp experience to non-participants. When larp documentation is implemented into the fiction of the larp, it becomes a diegetic part of the larp and creates more intimate documents of the elusive and coveted player experience.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this thesis was to create a tabletop roleplaying game adventure, designed to work independently of any pre-existing game system, thereby making it system-agnostic. The reason for making it system-agnostic was to maximize the number of people who could use it, rather than being limited to a specific system or ruleset. The thesis documents the steps of this process. It is divided into pre-production, production, playtesting, and iteration. As an introduction to the topic, a brief overview of roleplaying games was included. The history of roleplaying games and elements such as rules and resolution mechanics were discussed. Popular rule systems were compared, and guidelines were outlined for the system-agnostic adventure. The specific roles of individuals in a roleplaying game were analysed, and concepts such as player agendas, aesthetics, and social contracts in roleplaying were discussed. The tabletop roleplaying game market sector was researched to provide useful sales estimates to anyone interested in publishing or creating content for leading marketplaces. The outcome of this thesis is a set of best practices to use for a player focused game design, including an understanding of player motivations and how to fulfil them to create engaging gameplay. They serve as general-purpose tools that can be used in other contexts besides tabletop roleplaying games.},

Emergency managers (EM), who need special connections to those communication tools, are not considered. Instead, EM professionals are often accused of being a profession disconnected from the current technological reality. This issue is a paradox because it is a problem of technology–old is abandoned for new. In a similar way, tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) have been disconnected from game studies for decades though recent work has adjusted this oversight [1]. For researchers, TTRPGs provide context for how to consider systems, data-driven communication, and the role of data, all mental models from computational spaces in an original, or vintage, form. We call those who still play, design, or discuss TTRPGs vintage beings. The present research explores how vintage beings can use the shock of the old to connect younger learners to old tech and older learners to new tech.},

I discuss it as part of the recent participatory culture in which fans mediate existing fiction into other products such as games. Game studies have often bypassed types of gaming that are initiated by players themselves by taking professional and digital games as their starting points. By focussing on a local example of a fan game, I hope to provide new insights in game design and play. After disseminating between fan and game practices, and sketching some of the previous research thereof, I shall elaborate upon the design of the game in four ways by focussing on the designer, the context, the participants and its construction of meaningful play. I argue that the fan LARP displays a particular design perspective based on the co-creative ethos of role-playing and fandom itself. Whereas existing research isolates the actors that are relevant in game practices, designer, player and fan modes clearly interrelate here.},

  abstract = {This  paper  introduces an ecological approach to the performance of live action role-playing, commonly referred to as  larping.  Ecology  and ecological, in this context, are not used to explain our relation to nature and its protection, but  rather our relationship to our surrounding environment and other subjects dwelling in it. The approach was chosen because it provides the study with a comprehensive and an inclusive way of looking at performances.  Larps can be seen as performances from many points of view: it can mean displaying one’s skills in role-playing or in improvising; it can mean patterning one’s behavior to signify that of a fictional character; or it can mean keeping up a  vision or expectations of a fictional character. In addition – and what is especially the focus of this paper – the performance of larping can be understood as completing or carrying out actions that constitute the activity called larping.  To explain the ecological approach, this paper will first provide the reader with an overview of larps as ecologies, and then dissect the performance of larping into four steps that are essentially connected to each other in the ecology: information pickup, extraction of possibilities, choice-making and embodiment.  To summarize, a larp ecology is a comprehensive interdependent systems where all the players and other organic and non-organic components of the game  support  each other. In this ecology, the players pick up information,  extract  possibilities for  actions from that information, make choices on which possibilities to carry out and embody those choices by applying their bodily repertoire to the performance.},

Well-defined characters that are consistently communicated to players are an important ingredient in a potentially successful game.

The pleasurable role-playing experience thus requires a player to be able to present a character and (to some extent) experience what the character is experiencing.},

Embodied cognition theories assume that cognition is not only a feature of the brain, but the body as a whole and it is interaction with the environment it operates in. Grounded cognition proposes that an action, perceiving an action, and thinking about an action rely on the same processes. Moreover, knowledge is inseparably grounded to bodily states and modalities. Based on the grounded cognition theory and especially embodiment, we argue the character immersion and bleed are natural consequences on how the brain works. Also we illustrate how the operation of simulators explains some of the central features in the creation of fiction and it is similarities to our everyday experiences. In general, grounded cognition provides a rather simple explanation how fiction is experienced as in this theoretical framework action and thinking about an action largely utilize the same brain mechanics and so are phenomenally similar.},

  abstract = {Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPG) like Dungeons \& Dragons are unique phenomena within the topics of game-based learning and gamification of leadership development. Games in general are used for both game-based learning (learning from playing games) and as sources of inspiration for gamification: the application of game design elements in non-game contexts like business or education. Many potential benefits of playing TRPGs have been observed including transformative experiences linked to collective creativity. Knowing more about the transformative potential of TRPGs can inform facilitation of creative learning environments and guide the use of TRPGs for leadership development. The concept of a holding environment frames play and creativity as activities that promote personal growth embedded in a psychological or group environment. Drawing from a developmental environment framework, a gaming environment can be considered as the psychological group environment present while playing a TRPG. Applying this developmental environment framework to TRPG groups builds on previous research that reports transformative growth in TRPG experiences by providing a group level of analysis. This research explored gaming environments in TRPGs, specifically Dungeons \& Dragons 5th Edition (D\&D 5e). This qualitative study employed content analysis, group observations, and interviews for data collection and analysis. A group of participants was solicited to play D\&D 5e specifically for this research. Thematic analysis was used to identify group interaction patterns by observing the group playing D\&D 5e over the course of several sessions. Then, semi-structured interviews with the participants were conducted to investigate individual perspectives of specific observations from the group sessions. Interview topics included descriptions of the group of players, defining events in the group, and factors influencing the play experience. Recordings of gaming sessions and transcripts of individual interviews were subjected to continued analysis. Findings indicated that the gaming environment was a psychologically layered container which depended on the use of authority in leader-member relationships and utilized framing and storytelling processes for containing emotions. These findings can be used to inform the design of TRPGs for leadership development and expand how we construct knowledge about group environments in creative contexts.},

Building on previous research that documented players engaging in role-playing games, livestreaming, and role-playing game (RPG) fandom subculture, this study specifically explored the perspectives of individuals who reported a transformational impact of experiencing gaming vicariously through watching Critical Role. This paper reports a detailed narrative of one of the cases from qualitative interviews, which conveys major themes that illustrate the perspective of the individual watching. The paper compliments this detailed case description with a discussion of findings from seven in depth interviews to explore the experiences of the interviewee focused on in the context of the study sample. This study is primarily focused on the individual watchers’ experience of gameplay and role-playing experiences, which they attribute to personal growth. The term parasocial gaming is introduced to characterize a part of vicarious experience associated with watching media figures playing games.},

  abstract = {The current paper explores a transformative approach to leadership that integrates with a view of analog role-playing games (RPGs) as a system for human interaction, aiming to leverage these experiences and foster collective creative leadership. In the face of urgent global challenges, traditional leadership models prove inadequate, necessitating a shift in understanding leadership as a process of adaptive change among human groups. Drawing on phenomenology, relational sociology and constructivist perspectives, I advocate for a conceptualization of leadership as a socially constructed, meaning-making endeavor mutually embedded within and generating cultural context. I emphasize the essential role of collective cultural approaches and propose a co-creative education process that incorporates play and creativity for effective leadership development. Then, I delve further into the intersection of leadership and play, highlighting the potential of RPGs in facilitating transformative, collective creativity. The proposed model views RPGs as Leadership-As-Practice Development (LAPD) and explores how analog RPGs can be employed as dynamic platforms for leadership learning, identity development, team-building, and symbolic storytelling processes.},

The tale was, however, born in-game when it was inscribed in the character’s diegetic journal, and told aloud in-game, in a world where oral storytelling is a sacred practice. This piece evocatively demonstrates the rich lived experiences that flourish in role-playing games, and honors the powerful and nuanced aspects of world-building that color the plots we traditionally document.  -Emma Waldron},

This transmedial foundation, which continues to grow, prompts several questions. What allure does the storyworld hold for both audiences and producers? How do works engage with its core elements in familiar yet media-specific ways? How has this developing storyworld contributed to 'pulp' writer Lovecraft’s apparent elevation into the American literary canon? In this essay I explore the poetics of the Lovecraft storyworld’s development, its transmedial adaptability and its cultural significance for both contemporary audiences and Lovecraft's legacy.},

As a researcher, my experience conducting playtesting and ethnographic work for a roleplaying game on the Holocaust called “Rosenstrasse” profoundly affected me. In this PechaKucha, I ponder how roleplaying games might inspire the communication of ethnographic insight. As a medium in which storytelling isn't linear or prescribed, how can roleplaying games effectively transfer cultural understanding? Just as a Games Master and game design facilitate this knowledge transfer, perhaps ethnographers can use techniques similar to roleplaying to increase change-making by enabling greater agency in stakeholders and teammates.},

Larps are a variant of play that combine the “role-playing” of games, such as Dungeons \& Dragons, with the “live action” aspects of sports. Using symbolic interactionism as its paradigmatic orientation, this study examines how the magic circle is reinforced and challenged through the development of ingame characters and their effect on the out-of-game self. The respondents of this ethnography participate in a larp called Dagorhir (1977-), which puts an emphasis on live action combat rather than role-play. Participants are part of the Las Vegas realm of Dagorhir, Barad’Dun. Players view Dagorhir as a full contact sport mixed with martial arts; role-playing and character development is encouraged, but not necessary. I observed, interviewed, and participated with this group over the period of six months. Even in a combat-oriented larp like Dagorhir, players get to choose names, weapons, clothing, fighting techniques, and other ways to develop their in-game characters; this ability establishes a connection between leisure larps and edu-larps.},

Data revealed that fantasy gamers were different from satanic dabblers in major personality characteristics, paranormal beliefs, and interest in satanic practices. Satanic dabblers were significantly higher on psychoticism, introversion, and belief in the paranormal.

  abstract = {There are a wide range of therapeutic factors that contribute to the growth and change of individuals taking part in group psychotherapy. Over time, many scholars have worked to describe, categorize, and measure these factors, to mixed success. All the while, similar types of groups have also been simultaneously yielding positive mental health benefits, while not receiving the same attention in the literature. One such type of group consists of those who gather for the purposes of playing tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). These games, which often involve imaginatively traversing planets, medieval kingdoms, or haunted forests, have been demonstrated to facilitate positive social and mental health outcomes in their players. Despite this, limited research has been done on the similarities between the two types of groups. Across two studies, I explored the specific factors of TTRPGs that players found to be helpful to their mental health. Responses were assessed using qualitative analysis and presented in the form of emergent themes, which were then subsequently compared with widely cited therapeutic factors of group therapy. Similarities and differences between group therapy and TTRPG groups are then discussed along with limitations of this study and directions for future research.},

L’analyse critique des jeux existants, de parties jouées et la construction argumentée de propositions créatives permet d’élaborer un ensemble de concepts d’abord destinés à armer la discussion critique de jeux et parties empiriques. Ces concepts sont structurés en couches, en partant de l’interaction minimale de jeu – la boucle description du meneur/décision des joueurs/résolution de ces décisions – jusqu’à la conception du monde du jeu et des relations meneur-joueurs.Cette construction est charpentée autour de la notion de désir (des sujets-joueurs), de ce qui y résiste et du conflit qui en résulte. L’extension progressive de ce cœur conceptuel à des formes ludo-narratives de plus en plus larges (scènes, quêtes, campagnes, personnages, mondes) permet de mettre en lumière toute la complexité de la mise en relation des désirs qu’opère le jeu de rôle. Les conséquences de ce qui peut sembler n’être qu’une simple procédure (la boucle de jeu) sont ainsi analysées comme les virtualités de scénarios entrant en conflit à travers une institution partagée : le monde du jeu. Cela démontre enfin les spécificités communicationnelles du jeu de rôle par rapport aux formes transitives de « communication », et permet de mettre au jour la singularité de sa contribution aux débats théoriques autour des notions de communication, de fiction, de jeu et de récit.},

Le rapport, nourri de nombreux exemples, étudie la question du jeu en bibliothèque, qui est aussi celle de la prise en compte des usages et des attentes de publics larges, de la légitimité de pratiques différentes. Quelle politique et quel projet mettre en œuvre autour des jeux, jouets ou jeux vidéo? Quels partenariats tisser et comment prendre en compte le territoire ? L'introduction de jeux ou pratiques ludiques en bibliothèque territoriale et universitaire pose des questions d'organisation, de droit, de méthode, d'aménagement, de management, et interroge l'identité même des bibliothèques et la place qu'elles veulent tenir dans la cité.},

  abstract = {SÄRÖT trilogy was a pilot project, testing and developing Nordic Larp as a method in mental health- and substance abuse work. The larps took place in southern Finland in autumn 2020 and illustrated the experiences of mental health patients, substance abusers, and their bystanders. Data was collected from all three larps, and from their preparations and follow ups, aiming to figure out: -How did SÄRÖT impact its participants well-being? -What features of SÄRÖT were transformative? and -How could SÄRÖT be further developed into an actual method for mental health- and substance abuse work? Multiple methods, including WHO5 questionnaire, observation, workshops, email interviews, and free feedback, were used to gather versatile data out of a relatively narrow pool of respondents. Although WHO 5 is not a diagnostic tool, it has been successfully used to measure change in (experienced) well-being in art therapy groups1. Triangulation and theme analysis were used to analyze the data. Most of the WHO5 answers from before the games differed from the ones after the games, indicating a change in their well-being. In the interviews, observation, and free feedback the respondents reported changes in the way they experience their current situation in life. A new willingness for discussion or receiving help came up in several feedbacks and interviews. Some reported having processed their own traumas, gaining tools for dealing with e.g., PTSD, or making active changes such as applying for a new job, getting help for mental health issues, or turning to social workers because of the SÄRÖT experience. According to Moreno2, empathizing with the portrayed character is transformative. It also enables facing reality from a new perspective, providing tools for our own lives3. SÄRÖT is an example of this transformativity. However, the most impactful part of SÄRÖT were the workshops and conversations after the games, which is reminiscent to replication therapy4. SÄRÖTs transformativity was partly caused also by SÄRÖT having an objective, and the participants being aware of it. SÄRÖT has potential to become a purposeful tool for healthcare, service, or a product, if it is further developed with health care professionals and larp-designers. 1 Zubala et al. 2016; Topp et al. 2015 2 Moreno 1946 3 Carlson 2004, 75 4 Serbin \&amp; Allen 1968; see also Lehto 2021, 76},

  abstract = {Do role-playing games (RPGs) affect the player’s well-being? Several studies suggest that they might have an impact, but the topic of RPGs and well-being is usually only mentioned as a side note or curiosity. A clear, coherent picture on the topic of RPGs and well-being is missing. This review article aims to provide that picture by compiling the already existing knowledge in one place. I ask the questions: What can we learn from the already existing research? How should RPGs and well-being be studied? What questions need resolving? What can be gained from studying RPGs and well-being? RPG studies is a young academic interdisciplinary field of research, as is also the research of arts and well-being. They both are heterogeneous and related to a variety of academic traditions. They both are also dispersed, pragmatic, and until recently, scattered and lacking cohesive traditions or methodologies. Many basic ontological questions remain unsolved and the definitions of key concepts vary. They overlap in several discourses, such as the ones about (1) practices of sociodrama and replication therapy; (2) social, cultural, and digital capital; (3) leisure time research; (4) performance studies; (5) the topic of erotic role-play; (6) problematic vs. therapeutic gaming; and (7) health education. Previous research and practices focus mainly on live action role play (larp) and well-being, suggesting a positive impact. Online RPGs share their own traditions, but studies on tabletop RPGs and well-being are difficult to find. The studies are often case-studies or examine abstract topics such as human experiences. In these studies, it becomes evident that RPGs do indeed impact well-being. However, questions such as how, why, and what features in RPGs affect well-being remain unanswered. In addition, the research has mainly been executed from the perspective of either RPGs or arts and well-being. Interdisciplinary cooperation is the key to successfully diving into the world of RPGs and well-being. Doing so would offer both fields useful practices, interesting perspectives, new opportunities for publication and academic discussion. It would not only add knowledge about RPGs and well-being but offer perspective to the unresolved ontological questions of each field. Eventually, further study on RPGs and well-being could transfer into the usage of RPGs in the fields of well-being, health, and therapy in a similar manner that arts are currently being used.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the challenges that may emerge for live action role-play (larp) communities at each inflection point of the group life cycle. According to Tuckman, groups mature over time and move through four stages: forming, norming, storming, and performing (e.g., Tuckman 1965; Tuckman and Jensen 1977). The aim of the present chapter is to discuss the ways in which the development of real larp communities fit with Tuckman’s theory and to highlight inconsistencies that may emerge, in particular due to the multiple layers that can comprise a role-playing experience (e.g., Fine 1983). Since each stage of the group life cycle is fraught with opportunities for member exit and group dissolution, we also argue that cultural practices of successful, long-standing larp communities have manifested to meet these challenges. For example, larp groups may begin a new session with a  listen-up period in which players gather in a circle to discuss the rules and clarify any misconceptions before gameplay begins. This activity mirrors the “restorative circle” that can occur before schoolyard play (Costello, Wachtel and Wachtel 2010), which likely promotes group maintenance factors such as informal leadership and procedural voice. We hope this work will have applied value for members of successful larp groups that experience “growing pains” as, for example, the group enters the storming stage characterized by unclear boundaries and fragile self-esteem of group members (Thompson and White 2010, 4). Along  with the rules and activities described by role-play scholars (e.g., Montola 2008), this chapter draws on the practices common to a specific, anonymized larp group located in the United States. The scholarly foundation for this work is grounded in various disciplines, particularly industrial/organizational and social psychology, and role-playing studies.},

Players may achieve greater empathy for marginalized people (Galinsky and Moskowitz 2000; Greitemeyer and Osswald 2010) or undergo meaningful psychological change via intentional and unconscious self-exploration (Bowman 2007). However, not all of these stories have a happily ever after. This article examines the ways in which such role-play as a marginalized character can also have unintended negative consequences. We relate this larp activity to the phenomenon of dark tourism, in which privileged individuals voluntarily enter disaster zones due to a mix of motives that include voyeurism and vicarious danger exposure, carrying with them a mixed bag of intentions and outcomes. This review aims to answer the following question: What are the positive and negative outcomes of role-playing as a marginalized character? We will explore individual and collective outcomes of this type of experiential learning and make recommendations for designers and players to better achieve desired positive outcomes and limit the negative ones. Our work draws on research from games studies, experimental psychology, pedagogical studies, and the emerging literature about the motivations and consequences of tourism that seeks to touch on pain, trauma, and even death (i.e., dark tourism).},

  abstract = {Clinical High Risk for psychosis (CHR) refers to a phase of heightened risk for developing overt psychosis. CHR often emerges during adolescence or early adulthood. CHR has been identified as a group to target for intervention, with the hope that early intervention can both stave off prolonged suffering and intervene before mental health challenges become part of an individual’s identity. However, there are few treatment modalities that can address some of the specific needs of CHR. Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT) is an integrative psychotherapy that can be applied to the CHR population. MERIT offers unique advantages to working with the CHR population as it aims to improve self-direction and recovery through stimulation of metacognitive capacity, a phenomenon that has been associated with recovery. This paper explores unique aspects of the CHR population and how MERIT can address barriers to recovery for individuals experiencing psychosis-like symptoms. Several case examples and a clinical vignette using MERIT to support patients with CHR are offered to exemplify this approach. MERIT offers a way to assist persons with CHR to address barriers to their personal recovery and to develop nuanced understandings of ways to master challenges.},

  abstract = {Les jeux de rôle papier / crayon sont des jeux de société dont l’action se situe dans un univers imaginaire partagé par l’ensemble des joueurs~: on ne trouve aucune technologie immersive complexe et onéreuse. Cette absence de dispositif technique supprime les contraintes intrinsèques à tout jeu vidéo et jeu de plateau. Ce sont les joueurs, avec l’aide d’un maître du jeu (MJ), qui vont co-concevoir l’histoire en s’appuyant sur quelques éléments de décors préalablement posés. L’improvisation narrative est la clé de ce type de jeu. Adossé à des logiques de gamification ou de game-based learning, les jeux de rôle sont de formidables vecteurs de discussion qui nécessitent un engagement important et obligatoire de la part des participants. On entrevoit les trois conditions de la motivation identifiées par la self-determination theory~: l’autonomie, la compétence et les relations sociales (Deci \& Ryan, 1985~; 2000). Notre communication souhaite aborder un jeu en particulier~: Eclipse Phase. L’histoire se déroule dans un monde post-apocalyptique où le perfectionnement humain via la technologie (transhumanisme) est devenu la règle. Ce contexte permet d’imaginer une nouvelle modalité pédagogique pour l’apprentissage de l’anglais en école d’ingénieurs. En effet, l’immersion dans cet univers très technocentré, et donc axé sur les problématiques intéressants directement les futurs ingénieurs, nous semble pertinent pour faciliter le développement des compétences en langues.},

  abstract = {Particulièrement développée au Canada et dans les pays anglo-saxons, la ludopédagogie connaît actuellement un grand essor.1 Depuis que plusieurs études ont démontré que le plaisir est un moteur d’apprentissage2, de nombreuses initiatives de ludopédagogie ont vu le jour dans le monde. L’utilisation des jeux de rôle dans le but d’apprendre fait naturellement partie des initiatives liées à la ludopédagogie. Cependant, rares sont les projets portant sur l’enseignement (ils sont plutôt orientés sur la formation en entreprise). S’intéresser à l’efficacité de l’utilisation des jeux de rôle dans l’enseignement supérieur, et plus particulièrement dans le domaine du management, est donc une manière d’approfondir les applications déjà existantes de la ludopédagogie. Lors de la présentation du projet par M. Lépinard, chacun des membres du groupe a souhaité en découvrir davantage et étudier ces nouvelles techniques d’apprentissage. En effet, la ludopédagogie fait écho à nos diverses expériences en entreprise mais aussi à notre ambition de vouloir manager durant notre carrière professionnelle. D’autre part, certains membres du groupe étaient déjà familiarisés avec les jeux de rôle. Le projet “jeu de rôle en management” s’inscrit dans le cadre de nos études en première année de Master au sein de l’IAE Gustave Eiffel. Il est à l’origine de M. Lepinard qui avait déjà débuté des recherches et plus globalement du projet EdUTeam de l’Université ParisEst Créteil qui favorise la mise en place de projets ludopédagogiques. Nous avons cherché à comprendre les mécanismes d’apprentissage et les comportements managériaux pouvant surgir durant une séance de jeu de rôle afin de concevoir un “scénario type” permettant aux étudiants d’apprendre en s’amusant. Afin de répondre à ces questionnements, nous avons, tout au long du projet, mis en place des stratégies de recherche et d’expérimentation qui nous ont permis d’obtenir des éléments de réponse. Dans un premier temps, nous vous présenterons plus en détail la mise en place du projet puis son déroulement et nous terminerons par expliquer nos réalisations et les conclusions que nous en tirons.},

Composé de plusieurs sous-projets, nous nous intéressons ici à EdUTeam Wargames. Notre communication, issue d’un travail encore très exploratoire, puisque les premiers travaux sur ce type de jeux datent de juillet 2019, souhaite répondre à la problématique suivante : comment les wargames peuvent-ils contribuer à l’apprentissage expérientiel du management ? Pour se faire, nous rendons compte de la mise en place systématique de wargames au sein de chaque séance d’un cours d’introduction au management en 2ème année de Licence à l’IAE Gustave Eiffel (Université de Paris-Est Créteil, UPEC) afin de proposer aux étudiant·e·s des situations managériales réalistes, maîtrisées et à la complexité croissante. Les résultats les plus importants de cette implémentation originale concernent l’articulation réussie entre les situations managériales réalistes générées par les scénarios des jeux, le corpus de connaissances théoriques de base indispensable à tout futur manager et un référentiel de compétences créé spécifiquement sur la base du référentiel de la fiche répertoire national des certifications professionnelles (RNCP) du diplôme de Licence en Gestion. Pour autant, nous avons rencontré plusieurs obstacles qu’il conviendra d’étudier plus en profondeur : la dimension éthique des wargames, l’évaluation des compétences, la barrière de la langue puisque la grande majorité des jeux est en langue anglaise et la complexité des règles.},

  abstract = {Just a Little Lovin’ (JaLL), a live action role-playing (larp) portraying queer lives in the face of the HIV/AIDS crisis, provides an example of how a larp might connect participants to historical communities (Baird 2023). This connection may serve as a catalyst for an ongoing bond that might foster personal growth as well as present-day community building. There are many reports on the impact that the larp has had on the participants on a personal level (Baird 2021; Bowman 2015; Friedner 2022; Gronemann ed. 2013; Groth et al. 2021; Levin 2019, Stenros 2021; Stenros and Sihvonen 2019). Through the lens of emerging theories on transformational role-playing, new perspectives arise that enlighten these experiences further. Taking into consideration metareflection (Levin 2020), transformational containers (Baird 2021; Bowman and Hugaas 2021), and different types of bleed (Bowman and Hugaas 2021; Kemper 2020), this article discusses what we might learn from role-playing queer history. I argue that in the affirmative space of the larp, playing queer personality traits that might have been suppressed has offered personal growth through emotional (Bowman and Hugaas 2021), emancipatory (Kemper 2020), and ego bleed (Beltrán 2012). However, continued development of marginalized personality traits might require extended integration work, for which post larp practices are just emerging. Through the feeling of belonging to historical queer movements that JaLL offers, participants have been spurred to reach out to queer communities of the present-day, and have also built their own queer communities, both of which may support prolonged integration and development processes. These perspectives might aid in a continued development on post-larp integration practices and community building, as well as open up the possibility for other marginalized groups and historical movements to consider how they might benefit from their own bespoke larps.},

Designers and researchers have tried to identify how aspects of TTRPGs facilitate collaboration, immersion, creativity, and more. However, there has been no attempt to develop a formal assessment methodology for player experience during TTRPG play. This paper argues that evaluating TTRPG players’ experience can provide vital data for Game Masters to improve on their future games, for players to reflect on their experience, and for TTRPG designers or event organizers to collect and compare data. As a first step towards developing such an evaluation method, we identify important dimensions of TTRPG play that can be meaningful to track and actionable to improve upon. Moreover, we review player experience dimensions and evaluation methods in digital games, and explore similarities and differences with TTRPGs.},

First, the nature of the text is determined and analysed, after which various complications and challenges that are specific to the text are discussed. Based on these findings, a suitable translation strategy or strategies will be chosen and applied to the translation. The conclusion of this thesis states that, in order to produce such a working translation of The Player’s Handbook, a combination of several strategies will need to be applied.},

Historically, practices akin to role-playing and simulation is quite a bit older as tools for learning or social meaning making, but after the birth of Dungeons and Dragons the hobby community quickly took up this more serious mantle as well. Looking to a few unfortunate cases, and the obvious psychological power of role playing experience, many came to believe that role playing can have a profound psychological impact, but few evidence based studies have been published (for a review, see Lieberoth \& Trier-Knudsen, 2015). Sometimes the therapeutic concept of “”Psychodrama”” is evoked as an earlier 20th century case (and suggested efficacy) of role playing as a positive tool for personal and psychological change, but digging a bit deeper, it turns out that early 20th century social psychologists conducted quite a few experiments of the effects of taking on alien roles and perspectives on attitudes and personality (Bowman \& Lieberoth, in review). This presentation reviews what a hundred years of forgotten non-gaming psychology studies revealed about the effects of roleplaying – long before LARP and Dungeons and Dragons.},

Completing ethnographic research through and about the pandemic required a radical reframing of my methodology, not only during the research but also afterward as I began writing. How do you explain what it was like to live, play, and research during such a profound and collective experience? I studied face-to-face tabletop roleplaying (ttrpg) game communities, their process of losing the table, and finding it again online. The purpose of the interactivity in the piece is to bring to bear the experiences of living through a pandemic and political unrest, which melded pain and play together through the tools of play found within the community I observed and participated in, that of the ttrpg players in the Midwest, USA. This particular piece is a rumination on the methodology of writing, what my experience means in this context, and explores the what, how, and why of tools being used. Some of these tools will be utilized here where space allows.},

  abstract = {The following piece explores the methodology of the dissertation I am currently constructing, which plays with form, employs short stories created through play, fictional characters who act as guides, and interactivity, asking the reader to add commentary, reflect on their own experiences, play games, and change the work itself as they read. Completing ethnographic research through and about the pandemic required a radical reframing of my methodology, not only during the research but also afterward as I began writing. How do you explain what it was like to live, play, and research during such a profound and collective experience? I studied face-to-face tabletop roleplaying (ttrpg) game communities, their process of losing the table, and finding it again online. The purpose of the interactivity in the piece is to bring to bear the experiences of living through a pandemic and political unrest, which melded pain and play together through the tools of play found within the community I observed and participated in, that of the ttrpg players in the Midwest, USA. This particular piece is a rumination on the methodology of writing, what my experience means in this context, and explores the what, how, and why of tools being used. Some of these tools will be utilized here where space allows.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread implementation of psychodrama, no empirical studies investigated neural mechanisms of its techniques. One gap lies in the sociocognitive model of role reversal (RR) which posits three processes: empathic role-taking, behavioural reproduction and role feedback. Related studies found deactivations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during acting tasks, implicating inhibited self-related cognition. However, contrasting studies found PFC activations during role-taking, citing blurred boundaries between self and other that is characteristic of empathy. This study employs fNIRS to uncover neurophysiological correlates of the three processes. Three conditions (Naturalistic Conversation - NC, Role-Play - RP, Role Reversal - RR) were designed to introduce empathic role-taking and behavioural reproduction, and role feedback in transitions from NC to RP, and RP to RR respectively. 41 non-clinical adult dyads underwent all conditions. First-level General Linear Model from fNIRS signals was based on participants’ role-related utterances and compared across conditions. Anterior left PFC activity decreased as participants produced role-related utterances during RP compared to NC, implying lowered recruitment of self-referential networks during empathic role-taking and behavioural reproduction, partially supporting patterns of brain activation that can be mapped to specific sociocognitive processes in RR. Findings partially support the involvement of self-referential networks in specific sociocognitive processes in RR.},

  abstract = {Background Role-play, or the transient embodiment of a different role from one’s own, is a uniquely human activity that permeates many aspects of life. However, what psychosocial factors is one’s involvement in role-play associated with? Current role-play research tends to focus on limited variables and is partially marred by negative perception towards role-play in the context of online gaming. Nonetheless, it is undeniable that role-play has potential to elicit psychosocial benefits, including improvements in empathy, resilience, and self-esteem, as well as the amelioration of psychopathology. Therefore, the present study conducts a large-scale survey to identify significant psychosocial benefits that are associated with the individual’s engagement in role-play activities. Background variables such as sociodemographic and personality factors are also included to enhance understanding of types of individuals who engage in role-play. Methods A total of 265 adults were recruited for this study, and data were analyzed using two analytic methods: (1) multiple logistic regression and (2) machine learning, namely support vector machine. Results Results from both methods agreed that higher openness to experience, a personality factor, significantly increases the likelihood of the individual having reported previous role-play experience. Discussion While findings remain inconclusive regarding associated psychosocial benefits of role-play, results suggest significant predisposing factors that shape the individual’s tendency to engage in role-play activities. Conclusion The present study provides a large-scale investigation into a wide scope of psychosocial and predisposing factors associated with the individual’s role-play experience. Using two analytic methodologies, it was found that there are significant predisposing personality traits that increase the likelihood of the individual engaging in role-play activities.},

By making use of scientometric analysis, particularly document citation analysis and keyword analysis, this study maps out dominant research domains in psychodrama since its inception. From these findings, projections of future research trends and an evaluation of psychodrama research are discussed. Generally, there has been an increased adoption of technology to facilitate psychodrama practice, along with an increasing integration of psychodramatic principles with other psychotherapies. To improve research in this area, this paper recommends greater transparency in the reporting of materials, processes and data used in publications. Finally, we encourage embracing new technological methods such as neuroimaging to provide greater insight into mechanisms of change in psychodrama. The field of psychodrama remains full of potential and innovations to be developed.},

  abstract = {Interpersonal synchrony is a crucial construct in understanding social interactions, which has been used in clinical studies to measure the quality of the therapeutic alliance. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the correlation between synchrony expressed on different levels: behavioural and neurophysiological. Furthermore, there are no studies that examine how the implementation of psychodramatic role-playing techniques, when individuals adopt the persona of a different character, may influence intrinsic biobehavioural synchrony between two parties. The present study, therefore, aims to uncover the relationship between behavioural and brain-to-brain synchrony across different role-playing techniques and elucidate the impact of these synchronies on participants' levels of anxiety and empathy. By using functional near-infrared imaging and behavioural coding in a dyadic role-playing paradigm (n = 41 dyads), the study found correlations between behavioural and brain-to-brain synchrony during naturalistic conversations, but not during role-play, implying a qualitative change in interpersonal synchrony when implementing role-playing techniques. Additionally, the study noted significant contributions of both behavioural and brain-to-brain synchrony as well as peripheral factors such as dyadic sex make-up and role immersion in predicting dyadic anxiety and empathy changes. Findings call for future studies to consider role-playing scenarios as a qualitatively different form of social interaction.},

  abstract = {Trans-reality games are games combining virtual gaming with game experiences staged and played in physical environments. Mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive gaming technologies provide a facilitating infrastructure for trans-reality games. The technical infrastructure must integrate physical game elements with virtual game elements, ideally allowing game play and components to move as "seamlessly" as possible through these spaces as parts of a single coherent game world. This means the preservation of the sense of identity of game objects through their manifestation in different physical and virtual realities, the propagation of the significance of game actions and events through these realities, and game mechanics that weave those events into a coherent game concept. The development of design principles and methodologies for trans-reality games requires a model of the relationships between the functional roles of players and technologies, how these vary with different game staging and scenarios, and how these variations can be integrated within games that involve different modes of physical, virtual and mixed reality game play. In the case of trans-reality role-playing games (TRRPGs) these questions extend to issues of characterization and story construction. The concept of a TRRPG extends and evolves existing role-playing game (RPG) forms including table-top (TTRPG), live-action (LARP), computer-based, and especially massively multiplayer on-line (MMORPG), RPGs. A game system consisting of core rules and basic models for such things as characters and objects, their features and capabilities, combat, economics and trading, can often be used across all of these different contexts. However, despite this trans-mediality of the game system, the experience of characterization and narrative depth among different RPG forms is fundamentally different, largely due to radically different modes of story construction among the different forms. Previous work has analysed the relationships between simulation, game play and narrativity in computer games (see Aarseth, 1997, Frasca, 2001, and Lindley, 2003). These distinctions can be generalized into a model of the structure of all RPG forms, including table-top and live-action RPGs. The simulation level generalizes to a simulation/realization level providing a world within which game and story experiences take place. The game world may be realized with a literal representation (the game space stands for itself), synthetic or fictional representation (the world is realized symbolically), or some hybrid of literal and synthetic elements. The simulation level also includes foundations for realizing a range of possible literal or symbolic actions. This is the lowest level of temporal design in a ludic system upon which is superimposed a game level that includes rules specifying actions constituting valid game moves together with objectives for players to achieve by the performance of game moves. The time structure of each move requires a higher level of design than the simulation/realization level. However, the potential for players to choose moves results in a very loosely predefined time structure above the level of moves within the design of a game. Above the level of game moves, narrative is perceived when an experience in time has an overall shape conforming to a specific narrative pattern, such as the three-act restorative structure. This is the highest level of predefined time structure. In general a narrative is a representation of events. In computer games this often has the form of a filmic story told by cut scenes and framing the play experience (performance of moves) at a high level. Structural theories of textual and verbal narrative posit a generative substrate (a cultural space of possible stories) underlying the diegesis or specific objects and events of a particular narrative. The diegesis and its events constitute a story. The selection and presentation of elements of the story, with expressive variations of emphasis, constitute a plot. The plot is expressed in an act of telling, ie. a particular narrative. The available text is the narrative, while the other layers of meaning are inferred from the text and its relationship with other texts. Considering narrative construction and encoding within RPGs reveals very different relationships to this model. A TTRPG may be based upon published game worlds, scenarios and systems including elements of classic textual narrative. This provides the foundation for a game master and group of players to improvise a new (primarily verbal) narrative through the unfolding play sessions of a TTRPG campaign. Improvisation involves assembling sequences of fictive blocks, basic fragments or units of fictional/narrative significance that may be strung together to form a higher level narrative (Mackay, 2001). The fictive blocks include moves and text provided by the game system together with those drawn from the players’ imaginations and experiences. A computer-based MMORPG, however, provides players with a finite and fixed set of possible moves, together with the media foundation for realising moves as audiovisual and simulation events. Hence the MMORPG player generally chooses from predefined fictive blocks, supplemented by textual interaction with other players via chat facilities. This is a severely constrained improvisational freedom compared with the other RPG forms; the computer RPG removes much of the space for individual interpretation and imaginative elaboration by providing very explicit visualisations together with very limited options for improvisation. Collaborative story formation in LARPs is different again. While a TTRPG collaboratively produces a collective text upon which individual acts of imagination build, a LARP consists of a kind of performative multitext; there is no central social representation (or narrative), and there is a different story for each player, none occupying a privileged position as keeper of a primary story. The LARP setting may vary in its diegetic freedom between that of a MMORPG and that of a TTRPG, depending upon the literalness of representation of its setting, costumes, props and performances. LARP performances have the full advantage of all avenues of direct, face-to-face human communication, leading to the possibility of the highest levels of immersive and emotional experience. A trans-reality RPG (TRRPG) must integrate the different narrative modalities of RPG forms into a coherent overall system. This requires a careful mapping of player roles and technical mechanisms onto narrative functions in ways that preserve or enhance the strengths of the different play modalities involved, and ideally feed the results of play from their strong modalities into the other modes to enrich the overall TRRPG experience.},

This paper addresses the problem of bringing story play into the orbit of formal writing by implementing digitally-augmented enactment to bridge the gap between concrete story ideas and the more abstract organizations for expression. Our approach provides children with an interactive experience and enables them to capture their imaginative play to support story expression (retelling or writing). We designed and developed a mixed-reality storytelling system that combines physical play and digital augmentation within a tabletop environment. The system tracks the physical figurines on the tabletop and produces an animated (cartoon) version of their story in real-time, which the children can then view and use as a memory aid and dynamic outline for writing. In addition, to support a viewpoint-dependent narrative thinking, we developed the concept of implementing a virtual camera that allows children to control the narrative perspective by physically manipulating how their story world is viewed. In this paper, we will present the design and development of our system and a pilot study we conducted with 6 children aged 7-12 where two children worked together on creating stories with and without using our system. We will present the preliminary results we obtained from the pilot study by analyzing the collected data including questionnaires, interviews, and the story videos and writings. The results show that children using our system exhibited greater motivation in creating stories and higher levels of collaboration and writing performance compared to traditional tabletop play.},

  abstract = {Background: Anxiety and loneliness are prevalent psychological issues faced by older adults. To tackle these concerns, group reminiscence therapy has been widely recognized as an effective non-pharmacological form of intervention. Despite its proven efficacy, the implementation of this therapy normally requires professional guidance, limiting its accessibility to specialized institutions such as hospitals. Objective: In this study, the objective is to empirically validate the effectiveness of a reminiscence therapy-based hybrid board game, Journey of Memories, in reducing anxiety and loneliness among older adults. Method: We conducted a 12-day randomized controlled study. A total of 38 elderly participants aged between 61 and 75 were recruited. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group (consisting of 20 individuals) and a control group (consisting of 18 individuals). Participants in the experimental group were required to engage in three sessions of the Journey of Memories hybrid board game intervention, with a 5-day interval between each session. No intervention was administered to participants in the control group. Results: The results found that after 3 sessions of board game-based reminiscence therapy, 20 participants in the experimental group showed significant reductions in anxiety levels (the State Anxiety subscale of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI-S] average scores decreased from 43.83 to 41.05, P\,=\,0.000, the Trait Anxiety subscale State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI-T] average scores decreased from 46.72 to 43.61, P\,=\,0.030) and loneliness levels (UCLA Loneliness Scale [UCLA] average scores decreased from 39.11 to 36.11, P\,=\,0.002). In addition, participants reported high scores of usability (3.77/5) and user experience (4.08/5). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the hybrid board game can effectively reduce older adults’ feelings of anxiety and loneliness while providing a satisfactory user experience, motivating them to participate in group reminiscence therapy.},

  abstract = {In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to preserving intangible cultural heritage (ICH) through games. From a combined game studies and heritage studies perspective, role-playing games (RPGs) have a unique advantage in that they immerse the player in a character to experience and understand the basics of culture in an engaging way. Among different types of role-playing games, live-action role-playing (larp) and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) have a great potential to promote the learning of intangible cultural expressions and traditions that make them available to a wider public. In China, MMORPGs have had a positive impact on preserving China’s intangible heritage in virtual space and larps, specifically in the form of Jubensha, are also playing an important role in the same way. The purpose of this study is to delve into how the ICH of China is being represented in MMORPGs and larps as an educational tool. With that target in mind, a close reading of selected MMORPG games -- A Dream of Jianghu and Justice Online -- and a larp game -- The Secret of the Gauze Lantern -- was conducted. The goals of this research are to understand what cultural experiences are integrated in those role-playing games to introduce Chinese ICH and explore the main differences between them in representing those intangible cultural elements. After analyzing these RPGs in-depth, I argue that both MMORPGs and larps show potential to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage of China; while MMORPGs present national-level intangible elements from different regions of China, Jubensha as a kind of larp focuses more on the indigenous traditions and customs of small-scale local areas.},

However, even though many new games appear every year, TRPGs still does not occupy a dominant position in the game market. Most gamers prefer video games and board games to TRPG. The aim of this project is to use qualitative analysis to investigate which parts of TRPG design prohibit players from engaging with TRPGs and then to create a novel TRPG that addresses these design problems. This project will combine newly formulated design elements into a game designed to attract new players and ensure that player engagement is sustained in subsequent play. The project focuses on the example of China, where many people play video games and board games, but few know about or play TRPGs. Therefore, this research will mainly study the gaming behaviour and feedback of Chinese participants to study what methods can attract Chinese players to TRPGs.},

On s’interroge alors sur le rapport des enquêtés à la masculinité dans les domaines de la scolarité, des relations amoureuses et amicales. Les difficultés qu’ils semblent rencontrer concernant l’affirmation de leur masculinité, en partie liées à des discordances dans le processus de socialisation, éclairent d’un nouveau jour l’engagement dans le jeu de rôles et font apparaître les fonctions d’évitement et de compensation qu’il est susceptible d’assurer.},

  abstract = {Learning experiences are not typically used to describe formal learning activities, such as in classroom, transmissive methods. Centred in the student, this term describe that the learner is experiencing something that, hopefully, contributes to a change in thinking, understanding, or behaviour afterwards. For this to happen, learning experiences should be active, meaningful, with social meaning, integrative, and diversified. We consider active learning experiences when the student has the main learning role. They should provide knowledge and skills that directly contribute to the learner's ability to perform more effectively in the context of workplace learning. Sharing and cooperation is fundamental, allowing the learner to interact with other active learners. The inherent increase in complexity demands the integration of different dimensions of knowledge, better achieved through diversified strategies. In this context, teaching and learning is more than the mere acquisition of content. It represents a process of learning by thinking-do-thinking. The learning experiences should be adequate to motivate the students and provide the necessary challenges for learning to take place. In this context, the concept is understood as a reinforcement of the goal of an educational interaction over its location (school, classroom) or format (course, program). The diversity of ways in which students can learn from and interact with teachers, in addition to the level of independence they may have when learning, is considerable. In this paper, we propose to include not only traditional transmissive approaches and practical work assignments but also designing and playing games. The latter is regarded as an integral part of the students' knowledge building, with the objective of being instructional with the main focus on the cognitive side of instruction. This approach is part of a broader pedagogical experience of applying gamification to a higher education subject in the course of computer science. It uses several game design mechanisms, such as adaptive challenges, rewards, curiosity and chance to increase the time students spend working, experiencing and learning. In addition to the award system that is being used to grade students, the learning experiences are also designed using game design patterns. We focus mainly in the design, development and assessment of a tabletop Role-Playing Game, with the purpose of providing an environment for reflection and concept learning regarding data survivability. The learning experience is evaluated through a specific Student Observation Record, evaluating the interaction between students, the dynamic of the learning experience and the overall learning degree.},

He started in the early 1970's designing war-games with the legendary Game Designers' Workshop. He did a bit of everything: he designed wargames; he ran the warehouse; he developed role-playing games when they were still in their infancy. He managed the Twilight: 2000 role-playing line (and authored seventeen of its titles). He contributed to just about every Traveller title GDW published. But Loren's lasting reputation was as editor (starting in 1979) of the Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society for its 24 issues, then for the next 53 issues of Challenge Magazine, and finally for 15 years of the revived JTAS Online. At JTAS Online, Loren wrote more than 400 editorials ranging from the mundane (read: product announcements and plugs) to the sublime (with insights into the game design process, or memories of his days at GDW). These thoughts come to more than 250,000 words; they preserve a unique view of a hobby that barely existed when his work began, and was acknowledged as mainstream as his work ended. Foreword by Steve Jackson. Afterword by Marc Miller. (To be clear, this is an edited reprint of Loren Wiseman's JTAS [at Steve Jackson Games] editorial work). It gathers his work in one place.},

Furthermore, we found a statistically significant correlation between Dungeons \& Dragons players’ scores in extraversion and their character’s charisma. The results are in line with more recent findings from Big Five research in the geek-culture and contradict older findings regarding a low extraversion and high neuroticism of Dungeons \& Dragon players.},

  abstract = {Resumo: Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo fundamentar teoricamente uma adaptação do jogo comercial de RPG Dungeons \& Dragons 4th Edition para a sua utilização no ensino de língua inglesa dentro de uma sala de aula. Para alcançar tal objetivo foram realizadas pesquisas teóricas sobre design de jogos, educação e RPG - Role Playing Game. Esta pesquisa também apresenta um resumo da compilação teórica sobre emoções e entretenimento, originalmente realizada pelo pesquisador finlandês, da área de design de games, Aki Järvinen. Para a realização desta adaptação foi feita uma extensa análise do jogo comercial Dungeons \& Dragons 4th Edition, em busca de conhecimento sobre sua construção, seguido da análise de um método tradicional de ensino de inglês e a estrutura física da sala de aula. Uma vez concluída a adaptação do jogo, um questionário foi desenvolvido para medir qualitativamente o entretenimento e as emoções dos jogadores sentidas durante uma aula utilizando o jogo adaptado, sob a luz da teoria da experiência do jogador desenvolvida por Aki Järvinen. Finalmente, após um experimento aplicado em sala de aula com um grupo de alunos iniciando o curso de língua inglesa, os dados qualitativos coletados com o questionário foram analisados. O resultado indicou que os alunos se sentiram mais entretidos e mais motivados durante a aula de inglês, utilizando o método com o jogo adaptado, do que a aula utilizando o método tradicional de ensino de inglês.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs)—like Dungeons \& Dragons—are a fascinating design space. In an industry like ours, where product release cycles regularly stretch to the half-decade mark at the high end, and even at the low end rarely compress lower than 6 months, a tabletop role playing game can offer creators the opportunity to rapidly iterate on their creative output. More than that, our table offers us the opportunity to test and explore the very essence of the creative process itself. In the era of Twitch and Critical Role, when the fifth edition of Dungeons \& Dragons is growing massively in popularity and profitability, if you haven’t begun exploring this fascinating tool, let me be the first to encourage you to do so. This chapter will explore some of the tabletop role playing games available to you and show examples for integrating procedural generation as a tool into your creator’s toolkit. Finally, we’ll tie it all together by discussing what the experience of creating content through a highly procedural, improv-heavy process can teach us about the nature of player stories, player engagement, and procedural generation’s goals, risks, and successes.},

It includes the visualization of the most important game mechanics, role distribution, management of a group of users, communication and finding new friends and crewmates. The main point of this application is to catch the attention of potential users with flexibility, simple but comfortable UX/UI design with smart space distribution which is very important in these kinds of leisure activities.  Mobile application is developed in Flutter SDK which allows to build the application for both IOS and Android platforms, which are the most popular and widely used platforms nowadays, using the same code base written in Dart language. The database which stores all user info is written in Firebase Firestore which is NoSql database. These stack of technologies provide all necessary tools to create efficient application with great security.  This document describes functional requirements, implementation, details about used technologies, used UI/UX techniques, concept of writing applications on a single code base for different platforms.},

It examines the cultural impact of specific role-playing aspects that have caused a “drop down” effect whereby RPGs feed upon common themes and tropes to impact gaming as a whole. For computer RPGs (CRPGs) and MMORPGs, changes in the rules may require explanations by the designers, such as an expansion for World of Warcraft that changed the process used by groups to divide their loot. The chapter also examines the cultural impact of RPGs through their dissemination as a thematic genre and discusses their representation in three other popular media: literature, film, and television. RPGs lend themselves well to fiction writing simply because of the formulaic manner in which campaigns, events, and games are structured. Often tracking versions of Joseph Campbell’s monomyth, RPG campaigns can form the basis of stories or encourage derivative texts.},

They must be focused around certain activities, values, uses of material artifacts, territorial spaces, etc. which significantly differentiate them from the wider culture. There is a great deal of overlap between the theories and work examining subcultures and fan studies.

  abstract = {During the 2020 Corona virus crisis in Lombardy, a "stranger time," social distancing made it impossible to a group of players to meet and play their favourite role playing game around a table. The game continued through a mobile messaging app, which allowed each participant to roll a standard (6-sided) die that the entire group could see (but not to roll more exotic dice). This lead to the research of variant rules that only required these rolls on part of the players, and we were delighted to discover that the legendary 1971 Blackmoor campaign of Dave Arneson was played with standard dice only. In fact, the primary combat system of the original edition of Dungeons \& Dragons by Gygax and Arneson (1974) borrowed from the 2d6-based Chainmail of Gygax and Perren (1971). The present paper regroups the 2d6 algorithms that were playtested in Barrowmaze, an "old school megadungeon" of Greg Gillespie (2014).},

Play-based activities are well suited for social skills interventions because the structure of the game play can easily incorporate the youths’ interests and can be designed to mimic social rules. Despite the wealth of literature on the topic of play-based learning, it is not clear how play factors such as play materials (toys, objects, imaginative spaces), permissiveness (player autonomy), and structure (role-based play, interaction rules) contribute to skill development. This paper reviews the literature on play-based social interventions and will compare three play-based approaches based on materials, permissiveness, and structure: (a) LEGO-therapy, (b) virtual environment social program, and (c) therapeutically applied role-playing games. Implications of the results for practitioners and researchers are discussed.},

Fantasy role-playing games (Dungeons \& Dragons, Rolemaster, GURPS), while they may involve some of those aforementioned elements, rarely focus on them. Instead, playing a fantasy role-playing game is much like acting out a scene from a play, movie or book, only without a predefined script. Players take on such roles as wise wizards, noble knights, roguish sellswords, crafty hobbits, greedy dwarves, and anything else one can imagine and the referee allows. The players dont exactly compete; instead, they interact with each other and with the fantasy setting. The game is played orally with no game board, and although the referee usually has a Performance is a major part of role-playing, and role-playing games as a performing art is the subject of this book, which attempts to introduce an appreciation for the performance aesthetics of such games. The author provides the framework for a critical model useful in understanding the art--especially in terms of aesthetics--of role-playing games. The book also serves as a contribution to the beginnings of a body of criticism, theory, and aesthetics analysis of a mostly unrecognized and newly developing art form. There are four parts: the cultural structure, the extent to which the game relates to outside cultural elements; the formal structure, or the rules of the game; the social structure, which encompasses the degree and quality of social interaction among players; and theaesthetic structure, concerned with the emergence of role-playing as an art form.},

Game play was conducted, managed, and observed through a virtual tabletop simulator during the 2020–2021 COVID-19 pandemic. Methods triangulation including semistructured interviews, journal prompts and entries, and observations were used to gather data from the study participants and game manager. Narrative data were coded and analyzed weekly to monitor for saturation and other quality controls. The data provided information from the perspectives of the game players leading and cooperating as a team. Data analysis resulted in three main themes (skill identification, social interactions, and leadership skills) and nine subthemes (weakness identification, problem identification, problem resolution, teamwork, delegation, conflict resolution, decision-making, emotional response, and empathy) demonstrating new learning capacities that were transferred socially to various life interactions. Results indicated that the participants gained the ability to recognize learned skills and how to transfer the new knowledge and skills from the campaign to their personal, social, and work lives. Study results increased the body of contextual knowledge on how professionals may view learning from gamification and role play opportunities and their recognition and perception of how to obtain new and transferable skills.},

This study was conducted on a sample of 35 fantasy gamers within the North Bay, Ontario community. Field notes on 20 gameplay sessions were taken as well as transcriptions of conversational interviews and follow-up interviews with participants. Finding suggest that Dungeons \& Dragons operates as a wispy community (Fine \& Van den Scott, 2011) that demands social stratification and regulation due to the chance and ambiguity embedded within the game. In order to regulate shared fantasy, Game Masters had to engage in complex role negotiations and mechanisms of social repair. Findings indicate that for Dungeons \& Dragons to operate to shared normative expectations, underlying trust and the preservation of the shared narrative must be socially upheld. A failure to maintain narrative-focused or for a Game Master to effectively navigate their social role causes players to engage in role-distancing behaviours or dismiss themselves from the wispy community completely. This research serves to highlight the importance of share social meaning and structure in all societies regardless of size (macro or micro) or stratification (rigid or wispy).},

  abstract = {Dungeons \& Dragons is more popular than ever, having outgrown its early years as a hobby to become a cultural touchstone played by millions and streamed to millions more on the internet. Through its many editions, it remains the definitive rules-bound storytelling game where friends role-play characters of their own making and use dice to invoke randomness. Relative to other hobbies, Dungeons \& Dragons and similar tabletop role-playing games require more social engagement, more meaningful choices from infinite possibilities, more in-depth use of the imagination to pretend to be someone you’re not, and more cooperation. The Psychology of Dungeons \& Dragons is relevant to players, game masters, and even game designers. It applies decades of established and cutting-edge research to help readers understand how playing the game drives behaviors, shapes play, impacts relationships, and changes players once they put away the dice. Every chapter concludes with specific, practical tips and takeaways for players and game masters to use not only in their games of Dungeons \& Dragons but also in any other tabletop role-playing game. Jamie Madigan is a psychology Ph.D. who has been playing and thinking about Dungeons \& Dragons since the 1980s. In this book, he will answer questions like:     What is it about playing Dungeons \& Dragons that uniquely appeals to our basic psychological needs?     What kinds of mental skills are needed to engage in role-playing where players take on the perspective of fictional characters?     How do we tend to form superstitions and otherwise think about lucky die rolls like critical hits?     What kinds of psychological short-cuts come into play when dealing with the overwhelming number of choices inherent to playing the game?     Is playing Dungeons \& Dragons online as satisfying and beneficial as playing it in person?     What social psychology dynamics are involved when players must cooperate, co-create, and work as a team?

The article presents some scientifically derived explanations as to why hypertext novels do not have a mass audience and why they are likely to remain a marginal contribution in the history of literature. Three explanatory frameworks are provided: (1) how hypertext relates to our cognitive information processing in general; (2) the empirically derived psychological reasons for how we read and enjoy literature in particular; and (3) the likely evolutionary origins of such a predilection for storytelling and literature. It is shown how hypertext theory, by ignoring such knowledge, has yielded misguided statements and uncorroborated claims guided by ideology rather than by scientifically supported knowledge.},

While research has investigated the role of training and simulations, little is known about how individuals develop improvisation skills when formal training is not an option and how individual-level factors shape development trajectories. We explore these issues in a longitudinal qualitative analysis of live action role-playing. Our findings reveal a three-stage process of improvisation development shaped by the presence of task and social structures, which act as both constraints and resources. Moreover, our findings illuminate how collaborative and competitive orientations shape whether improvisers perceive these structures as a resource that they need to nurture and renew (i.e., collaborative) or to seize and exploit (i.e., competitive). We also show that individual orientations are not always enduring but can change over time, engendering four types of improvisation development trajectories. Our work provides a longitudinal account of how individual orientations shape the process of improvisation development. In so doing, we also explain why individuals who are skilled improvisers do not necessarily improvise effectively as a collective, and we reconcile different conceptualizations of improvisation.},

Among game types, role-playing games yielded the largest mean effect size (g\,=\,1.828, k\,=\,5). The effect size of game-based learning was larger for critical thinking disposition (g\,=\,1.774, k\,=\,4) than critical thinking skill (g\,=\,0.661, k\,=\,17). Game-based learning also had a larger effect on students in collectivistic countries (g\,=\,1.282, k\,=\,10) than those in individualistic countries (g\,=\,0.432, k\,=\,10). Furthermore, this effect size was larger in later publication years. Lastly, the effect size of game-based learning on critical thinking was larger for studies published in journal articles (g\,=\,1.154, k\,=\,13) than theses (g\,=\,0.378, k\,=\,8).},

  abstract = {The society we live in leads us to rethink education and communication languages, especially in educational processes concerning children and adolescents. It seems increasingly difficult to build meaningful educational experiences able to involve young people in transformative processes and overcome the ingrained "nihilistic sense". The new digital paradigm and the evolving perceptions of corporeal forms bring some crucial changes we need to explore. The social science teachings need, therefore, to be renewed to better deal with knowledge and skills in an interactive environment, promoting creativity, aesthetics, global and critical thinking and to promote relevant societal change. A possible educational method to tackle these realities can be given by the Educational Live Action Role Play (hereafter "Edu-larp"). An Edu-larp is a live role-playing game in which the narration is not only told but also played in first hand by the participants with their body and their actions. Players interact each other by interpreting a character and playing fictitious situations in a real space ("magic circle"). Despite the Edu-larp still being a growth method, several studies are highlighting its specific benefits, which include: identity exploration, communities building and cooperation, transversal skills, didactic media, problem solving, empathy, and self-awareness. The presented study builds on the findings of an experimental research on two migration-themed Edu-larps: "Youth On The Run" which simulates the migratory journey of an asylum seeker family from Somalia to Italy for 24 hours; and "300, the battle of the tent cities" which simulates a 4-hour municipal meeting in which the participants have to decide the placement of 300 refugees arriving in their city. It aims to enquire whether both games have significant effects on the participants' empathy and ethnic prejudices. The research was conducted on 82 subjects who partook an Edu-larp, using an open-question survey, psychometric scales and Implicit Association Test (IAT). The test was iterated three times: one week before, one week after and three months after the game. This paper will present the research design, the first reflections on the relationship between a "game for social change", and possible Edu-larp paths in future of education.},

  abstract = {In role-playing games (RPGs), players are called upon to assume the role of a character moving in an imaginary environment and facing several challenges. Their success or failure often depends on randomizers like cards or dice. Regarding the latter, the most commonly used in RPGs are the Platonic solids with the addition of the ten-sided die. They are commonly simulated through classical computers, however, since true randomness is not in their nature, they can only generate pseudorandom numbers. On the contrary, quantum computers exploit the nondeterministic nature of quantum mechanics, so they are perfect candidates for truly random simulations in games of chance. For this reason, this paper proposes and tests various quantum circuits for sampling uniformly distributed discrete values within a fixed range, corresponding to the number of faces of the dice. The simulations reveal the pure randomness of the output of the implemented circuits. They were then used to generate random numbers within a three-dimensional dice-rolling game.},

  abstract = {To strengthen the motivation of learners, the professional training sector is focusing more and more on game-based learning. In this context, the authors have become interested in the design of Learning Role-Play Game (LRPG) scenarios. The aim of this article is to improve the designers’ confidence in the validity of the game-based learning programs developed by providing a methodology and tools to support their choices. The first stage of this work is the creation of a grid to describe LRPG scenarios. This grid will serve to support the design methodology, the collecting and sharing of LRPG scenarios and components, and the operationalization of the scenarios designed. First, this article details the purpose of the authors’ work. Then, it outlines the main characteristics of the description grid constructed mainly based on Klabbers’ work and on the study of game mechanics. Furthermore, applications of the description grid in a design-support environment are discussed and future work is presented.},

  abstract = {Learner motivation is a major preoccupation for a professional training sector that is showing increasing interest in the use of learning games. The lack of methodologies and design tools seems to be problematic for the eLearning companies and training departments placed in charge of learning game projects. In this context, we have focused in particular on the design of scenarios for Learning Role-Playing Games or LRPG because of their ability to suit to needs identified. This article presents the main characteristics of our work. Our aim is to guide designers in the choices they make, in particular when it comes to the use of tailored game principles, to help them formalise and justify their choices in relation with the project specifications and to facilitate the implementation of the scenarios they design. With this in mind, our work takes a two-pronged approach: first, the analysis and modelling of a LRPG scenario design process based on the re-use of models and, second, the specification of a design-support environment (ScenLRPG) based on the model devised. The paper then focuses on a key stage of our work: the identification of game principles that may be used in a LRPG scenario. Six game principles have been identified from the study of literature on games and motivation. The article describes how these game principles are specialized to cater with our specific subject that is LRPG scenarios for professional training. Our categorisation of these principles and characteristics about how they can be implemented in a LRPG scenario are detailed. As an illustration, the game principles selected are used to describe an example of LRPG scenario. To conclude, the paper discusses the future outlook for the use of these elements in the design process and the support environment.},

  abstract = {Introduction: One of the nursing activities in Primary Health Care is the nurse home visit, with the objective of establishing a follow-up of the various individuals and families whose health is at risk or affected. In addition, they should monitor the physical environment at home for elements beneficial or detrimental to health. Difficulties are observed in nursing students to be able to mentally stage the different theoretical clinical cases, being the nurse home visit one of these situations that covers this problem. The main objective is to improve nursing students' knowledge, skills and attitudes about nurse home visit using clinical cases with tabletop role-playing game mechanics.  The specific objectives are the following:  (1) to assess the usefulness and playable experience through the aforementioned mechanics in this context,  (2) to evaluate the students' performance based on the role played in the clinical case through the virtual tabletop role-playing game. Methods: The teaching methodologies used were gamification and case-based learning. In the days prior to the simulation of three virtual clinical cases, 3-4 nursing students were assigned as family members and patients for each one, sending them their corresponding house plan (produced using the Sweet Home 3D software) and a genogram of the family. For virtual simulation, Google Meet was used with Google Meet Dice Roller extension, allowing random events or factors to be added to the clinical cases by means of a virtual ten-sided dice (1: worst event, 10: best event). In each clinical case, a student volunteered to act as a nurse in the case, at which time the patient's clinical history was provided. Once prepared, the story of each clinical case was developed from the street of the patient's home until the end of the nurse home visit, with a maximum duration of 30 minutes. Teachers acted as game masters. A pre-test questionnaire of nursing home visit was distributed. At the end of the simulation, participants completed the GAMEX scale, while the assistants evaluated the organisational, communicative and improvisational skills of the student who acted as nurse. All students completed a post-test knowledge questionnaire together with items related to their role. Results: Prior to the simulation, 66.7\% (32) of the nursing students were familiar with role-playing games and 37.5\% (18) had previously played tabletop role-playing games. Participants highlighted that the tabletop role-playing game mechanics were very useful for the development of the virtual clinical cases (9.23 +- 1.14 points), highlighting high scores on positive emotions and low scores on negative emotions about their gaming experience. Attendees felt that the students who acted as nurses did not plan the nurse home visit well and sometimes did not pay attention to the physical aspects of the home. However, after the simulation, knowledge of the most important phase of the nurse home visit (planning) was significantly improved (Z=-3; p=0.003). Conclusions: The use of tabletop role-playing game mechanics in the simulation of virtual clinical cases has been positive for the improvement of some knowledge and skills about nurse home visit in nursing students. The gaming experience was rewarding for the participants, while the attendees were able to detect and observe the difficulties of nursing in the home environment.},

Modern examples from a wide range of media and genres-including Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and the novels of Helen Oyeyemi, the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and the role-playing games Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer 40K-are brought alongside episodes from ancient myth, important moments from history, and more.  All together, these multifaceted studies add to our understanding of how science fiction and fantasy form important areas of classical reception, not only transmitting but also transmuting images of antiquity. The volume concludes with an inspiring personal reflection from the New York Times-bestselling author of speculative fiction, Catherynne M. Valente, offering her perspective on the limitless potential of the classical world to resonate with experience today.},

Medievalism examines how different groups, individuals, or eras use and shape the image of the Middle Ages, differentiating between historical knowledge of the Middle Ages and what we have made the period out to be. The 13 essays in this book explore the medieval invasion of today's media and consider the various ways--from film and print to websites and video games--that the Middle Ages have been packaged for consumption. Essays encompass diverse theoretical perspectives and are grouped loosely around distinct functions of medievalism, including the exposure of recent social concerns; the use of medieval images in modern political contexts; and the medieval's influence on products of today's popular culture. The legitimization of the study of medievalism and the effect of medievalism on the more traditional subject of medieval studies are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Ce mémoire s’intéresse à la cohésion au sein des groupes de rôlistes lors des séances de jeu de rôle sur table (JDR). Cette activité prend la forme d’une construction collective d’un récit à travers la narration d’évènements et l’interprétation de rôles, le tout encadré par un système de règles variant d’un groupe à l’autre. Habituellement, l’un.e des participant.e.s occupe la position de meneur.se de jeu (MJ), qui se divise une double fonction d’auteur.rice et d’arbitre : il.elle agit en tant qu’intermédiaire entre les joueur.se.s et le récit, et veille au respect des règles de jeu. Si plusieurs études se sont déjà penchées sur le phénomène du JDR en tant qu’activité, bien peu portent spécifiquement sur la figure de MJ. Impliqué depuis plusieurs années dans des campagnes de JDR en tant que joueur ou MJ, nous avons pris part à plusieurs groupes et constaté que certains étaient plus cohésifs que d’autres et que les MJ possédaient une certaine influence dans ce processus. Ainsi, à travers cette recherche, nous tentons de comprendre la place qu’il.elle.s occupent dans la création et le maintien de la cohésion de groupe lors des séances de jeu. Pour ce faire, nous avons réuni un groupe de cinq rôlistes auquel nous avons administré en tant que MJ une courte campagne du populaire système de Dungeons \& Dragons. Pour notre collecte de données, nous avons eu recours à trois techniques complémentaires : un récit auto-ethnographique visant à livrer notre perspective de MJ lors des séances de jeu, un journal de bord afin de consigner et réfléchir les différents évènements de notre terrain et finalement trois sessions de focus groups afin d’obtenir le point de vue des participant.e.s. Cette triple perspective a ensuite fait l’objet d’une analyse thématique articulée autour des facteurs socio-affectifs et socio-opératoire de la cohésion de groupe identifié par Oberlé (2016). Ce processus nous a permis d’identifier neuf pratiques (ou actions), regroupées autour des fonctions d’auteur.rice et d’arbitre ainsi que de celle de leader.euse, permettant aux MJ de favoriser la cohésion de groupe. Il s’agit : du rappel aux objectifs communs, de l’administration des épreuves collectives, de la proposition d’épreuves collectives et d’objectifs narratifs, de la description d’univers fictifs et des actions s’y déroulant, favoriser l’agentivité narrative chez les joueur.se.s, représenter l’identité sociale du groupe, socialiser et participer à l’humour du groupe et finalement organiser les parties de jeu de rôle sur table. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  MOTS-CLÉS DE L’AUTEUR : jeu de rôle, meneur.se de jeu, cohésion, dynamique de groupe, auteur.rice, arbitre, leader.euse},

For example, in our Survey of Modern Games class for undergraduates at the University of Montevallo, we employ the following gamification techniques: displaying progress via boss fights and badges, employing narrative elements to create a cohesive semester-long story arc, and implementing a level-based grading system with experience points (XP). To introduce the gamification elements and lay the foundation for character analysis, we start the semester with a character creation assignment (which is labeled as a “dossier” to fit the overall theme) and a related discussion. Our use of a gamification assignment and follow-up discussion addresses ideological perceptions of identity via avatars and creates a safe space in the classroom for individualized student identities. The dossier task leads into discussions of gaming stereotypes and representation with an emphasis on challenging binaries present in this medium. While the assignment we outline is for a Survey of Modern Games class, it can easily be adapted to any course with narrative texts, be they literature, film, or games.},

I explore how sub-cultural processes in the construction of group identity are gendered through their relation to the manhood acts perspective (Schrock \& Schwalbe, 2009). I focus on how the meanings of actions by (mostly male) participants referred to as "epic glory" relate to the elicitation of deference, resistance of exploitation, and assertion of control key in signifying manhood. I then relate these group processes to the unintended consequences of perpetuating gender inequality within the group and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {In recent years TTRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Game) based shows or actual plays have seen amazing growth, with shows like Critical Role being the number one grossing channel on the streaming platform Twitch .TV and Dimension 20 becoming the flagship content for the newly rebranded Dropout.TV. This shows put in the forefront of their storytelling, chance, and the players´ ability to improvise, to the detriment of a traditional screenplay. The failure or success of every action and the making of every player character (the stats and backstory of the characters are rolled and fleshed out in pre-production phases) is often determined by luck of the draw (dice roll, card draw…), thanks to the rules provided by the TTRPG system of choice (in most cases Dungeons \& Dragons 5e). The system allows for Dungeon Masters (the players that run the game and consequently the story) to step out of the rules set and change the impact of some dice rolls, allowing the chance of a natural 20 on D20 roll to completely restructure the narrative of the story. Is this rolling of the die aspect and more important natural 20s and 1s where this study will focus, trying to comprehend how special they really are and how much impact they can have in the result of the show.},

  abstract = {Game historians usually trace the literary roots of role-playing games to J. R. R. Tolkien and other fantasy authors. In this article, the author argues that, although Tolkien indeed provided pioneer game creators with specific content, historians have missed the important early influence on game history of children’s literature that advocates and illustrates role playing. Game scholars nod to such child’s play as make-believe and playground games, they often cite accounts of personal experiences in the childhood play of game designers, and they credit game books as an interactive link to fiction, but they have not included children’s texts in their histories. The author argues for placing children’s novels in such histories, particularly Zilpha Keatley Snyder’s The Egypt Game, which this article describes in full as a cultural forerunner in the history of role-playing games like Dungeons \& Dragons.},

However, the U.S. Surgeon General notes that loneliness and isolation is an epidemic in the U.S., and that it is exacerbated for individuals with physical and mental disabilities as well as those with isolating economic or environmental situations. A recent review shows that many autistic adults in particular face challenges in finding the connections they want and need. They also often have compounding mental health conditions, such as depression and mental illness, lower incomes, isolating home environments due to a lack of resources, and significantly higher incidence of suicide deaths compared to non-autistic adults. However, there is still very little research on autistic adults, especially research that focuses on their wellbeing and that brings in their first-hand perspective.},

As technical communication researchers, we were fascinated by the online discussion around this event as news spread across various D\&D communities on the social media platform Reddit and even spilled out into broader roleplaying, gaming, and legal subreddits. Fans needed to reorient and resituate themselves across communities as developments unfolded, especially as moderators and prominent users strategically influenced the discourse within these subreddits. As both active members of these subreddits and researchers, we believe this case has much to teach the field of technical communication, particularly in the way it illustrates the need for tactical research methods when engaging with the shifting boundaries of social media research spaces. Researchers must also be savvy towards the limits of a platform, as well as their own positionality and their relationships to online communities when reporting on events. In reporting on the OGL case we aim to show how tactical research methods can help technical communication practitioners dynamically engage with social media platforms such as Reddit when studying events with widespread user engagement.},

  abstract = {Vers la fin du vingtième siècle, le tout jeune loisir ludique qu’est le jeu de rôle sur table – apparu vingt ans plus tôt – est victime d’une sorte de « chasse aux sorcières » médiatique en France, se focalisant, sans grande objectivité et sans grande réflexion, sur des faits divers certes sordides (crimes, suicides, sectes…) auxquels la pratique du jeu de rôle est associée - à tort ou à raison. Les parents s’émeuvent, les pouvoirs publics municipaux retirent subventions et locaux aux associations de rôlistes, le chiffre d’affaires des boutiques spécialisées baisse, certains éditeurs sont en difficulté… Malgré sa dispersion et son manque d’expérience, la communauté rôliste se mobilise et surmontera finalement ces temps difficiles, en s’appuyant entre autres, sur la création d’une fédération, la pugnacité des revues dont Casus Belli et son rédacteur en chef Didier Guiserix qui publiera également un ouvrage grand public et, de manière plus inattendue, la publication de la première étude française sur le jeu de rôle par… un officier de gendarmerie : Jean-Hugues Matelly, certes également rôliste. Dans « Jeu de Rôle », il prend le parti de reprendre point par point toutes les accusations alors portées contre le jeu de rôle et de démontrer, ici leur exagération, là, leur invraisemblance, à l’aide des outils de la criminologie, de la sociologie voire de la philosophie. Il est également le premier à tenter de positionner le jeu de rôle dans les grandes théories existantes sur le jeu, démontrant qu’il est une nouvelle forme ludique reposant sur des mécanismes de base qui fondent tous les jeux. Un quart de siècle plus tard, la présente réédition de l’ouvrage de 1997 est augmentée d’une postface de l’auteur, revenant sur les circonstances et le contexte d’écriture de l’ouvrage, sur son accueil et au-delà sur quelques réflexions d’un « vieux » rôliste.},

We offer examples of middle school students building science fiction explanations to justify their decisions during a week-long role-playing game (RPG) design workshop. Findings show how worldbuilding---that is, defining the game's setting, history, and characters---supported students in formulating relevant science questions, integrating various science ideas into complex mechanistic explanations, and articulating and critiquing ideas. They also show the challenges students faced in balancing fiction and science to create credible game worlds; and how differences in participation affected collaborators' ultimate abilities to explain. We conclude that RPG design has many affordances as a science learning environment, but also particular caveats for formal educators to bear in mind.},

  abstract = {Currently, barriers to access are high for new or inexperienced designers in the fields of tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) design. TTRPGs remain a relatively unexplored design space, to the detriment of designers and system homebrewers– those who wish to modify existing TTRPG systems, rather than write new ones. A useful solution to this issue is to compose a pattern language representative of these systems. A pattern language provides a useful blueprint for designers of complex design systems, simplifying the TTRPG design process. In this thesis, we create a conceptual language which presents a simple-to-understand method of developing a TTRPG’s core elements alongside a set of pre-defined options and goals. This pattern language will then be simulated by an application developed within the JavaScript engine Blockly, as both a demonstration and as a tool with which designers can write systems. This tool, which we have named Assemble, will demonstrate how designers could benefit from utilizing pattern languages in computer-aided design contexts for TTRPG systems.},

Famous Hollywood actors and directors, therapists, educators, politicians, kids, parents, and grandparents all count themselves as fans. In Welcome to Dragon Talk, hosts of the official D\&D podcast Shelly Mazzanoble and Greg Tito and their surprising guests show how this beloved pastime has amassed a diverse, tight-knit following of players who defy stereotypes.   Shelly and Greg recount some of their most inspiring interviews and illuminate how their guests use the core tenets of the game in everyday life. An A-list actor defends D\&D by baring his soul (and his muscles) on social media. A teacher in a disadvantaged district in Houston creates a D\&D club that motivates students to want to read and think analytically. A writer and live-streamer demonstrates how D\&D–inspired communication breaks barriers and empowers people of color. Readers will see why Dungeons \& Dragons has remained such a pop culture phenomenon and how it has given this disparate and growing community the inspiration to flourish and spread some in-game magic into the real world.},

However, geek culture is becoming increasingly mainstream; for example, in the past year alone, Dragon*Con, a major Geek convention in Atlanta, Georgia, attracted an attendance of over 57,000 members. The present article uses an individual differences approach to examine three theoretical accounts of geek culture. Seven studies (N = 2354) develop the Geek Culture Engagement Scale (GCES) to quantify geek engagement and assess its relationships to theoretically relevant personality and individual differences variables. These studies present evidence that individuals may engage in geek culture in order to maintain narcissistic self-views (the great fantasy migration hypothesis), to fulfill belongingness needs (the belongingness hypothesis), and to satisfy needs for creative expression (the need for engagement hypothesis). Geek engagement is found to be associated with elevated grandiose narcissism, extraversion, openness to experience, depression, and subjective well-being across multiple samples. These data lay the groundwork for further exploration of geek culture as well as provide a foundation for examining other forms of subculture participation.},

  abstract = {Fantasy has always had an uncomfortable relationship with race. J.R.R. Tolkien's inclusion of stereotypes, racial coding, and occasional explicit bigotry in his highly influential work has led to today's often controversial fantasy genre. Two such controversies regarding race and fantasy occurred in 2022: one came in the form of racist backlash to the reveal of Black actors playing elf, dwarf, and harfoot roles in Amazon Prime Video's new Tolkien-based television show The Rings of Power, and the other occurred when fans rallied against the inclusion of racist descriptor text in the "hadozee" character option released as part of the Dungeons \& Dragons "Spelljammer" expansion. In this thesis, I examine these two controversies from an ideological perspective for the purpose of contextualizing the various fan cultures involved within the broader framework of an ideological culture war. First, I define Tolkien fans as reactionary fandom and Dungeons \& Dragons fans as activist fandom. From there, I present a method through which both The Rings of Power and the Spelljammer expansion can be viewed as fan works in their own right. Then, I establish stakes by examining the problematic history of race in fantasy which has set a racist status quo. Following that, I analyze fandom activity surrounding the two controversies, including both the texts themselves and fan reactions to them. I conclude that the fans involved use fandom as a means by which they can express deeper held beliefs. Ultimately, the goal of this thesis is to investigate that relationship between fandom activity and ideology through the lens of racial controversy in the fantasy genre.},

  abstract = {Risk in Children’s Adventure Literature examines the way in which adults discuss the reading and entertainment habits of children, and with it the assumption that adventure is a timeless and stable constant whose meaning and value is self-evident. A closer enquiry into British and American adventure texts for children over the past 150 years reveals a host of complexities occluded by the term, and the ways in which adults invoke adventure as a means of attempting to get to grips with the nebulous figure of ‘the child’. Writing about adventure also necessitates writing about risk, and this book argues that adults have historically used adventure to conceptualise the relationship between children and risk: the risks children themselves pose to society; the risks that threaten their development; and how they can be trained to manage risk in socially normative and desirable ways. Tracing this tendency back to its development and consolidation in Victorian imperial romance, and forward through various adventure texts and media to the present day, this book probes and investigates the truisms and assumptions that underlie our generalisations about children’s love for adventure, and how they have evolved since the mid-nineteenth century.},

  abstract = {Collaborative worldbuilding is an ideal digital writing project for promoting critical thinking about contemporary issues, developing and applying disciplinary expertise writing transfer, and building digital literacies. In the context of the global Covid-19 pandemic where the student experience was characterised by isolation, collaborative worldbuilding also offered a powerful means of building solidarity and community. This paper presents a case study of using collaborative worldbuilding for gaming to achieve key digital writing learning outcomes. The case study shows how this innovative pedagogical approach can be mapped to two key frameworks for information and digital literacies: the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens and the Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education of the Association of College and Research Libraries. The case study also illustrates how a MediaWiki installation can be used for worldbuilding and as a means of critically introducing students to Wikipedia itself. Qualitative feedback from the students shows that the class achieved its key learning outcomes. More importantly, student engagement during the class and their feedback ascertains that collaborative worldbuilding is a powerful means of building connections and empathy between students in the context of isolation, amid a global pandemic. Practitioner Notes     The worldbuilding framework for collaborative writing developed by Trent Hergenrader can be adapted to contribute to the goals of a first-year seminar. However, there are logistical and technical factors to consider.     Worldbuilding for gaming is an engaging class activity whether used for online or in-person education.     Using a MediaWiki installation as the platform for digital writing is a felicitous means of imparting proficiencies identified by two information literacy frames, the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens.     Worldbuilding by authoring encyclopaedic entries on a MediaWiki installation allows for a critical consideration of Wikipedia itself.     Genre knowledge is essential to a student’s development as a writer. Discussions of knowledge transfer often focus on the ability of students to apply and transfer expertise across disciplines. Speculative fiction writing based on academic research is an example of knowledge transfer between genres.},

The combination of these elements allows for the construction of ‘dramaturgies of being,’ which facilitate the performance of identity within the speculative framework, and thus the testing of said identities. Avery Alder’s 2018 game Dream Askew presents a dramaturgy of being for queer postapocalyptic identity exploration, community building, negotiation of agency, and teaching through simulated experience.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Since the surge of the digital culture the society is passing through some great changes. This characteristic demands a new look and a new way of management in processes that involve human interaction. The education is one of the fields of study targeted for the implementation of these innovations, and the use of the techniques learned from the game studies is increasingly appearing on research and practices. The present research consists on a documental analysis of Role Playing Games (RPG) books aiming to identify the practices of the narrator of these games that can be used by teachers in their didactic activities. It?s a qualitative research applied to the teacher?s practice, with the objective explanatory- descriptive of analysing the game elements of Role Playing Games to use in didactic-pedagogical ends. As regard to the procedures, it?s a hybrid research, being a documental research using elements of case studies, mostly for dealing with books of reference material to RPGs and their possible application in learning environments. The RPGs are an activity that influences culture, mainly the entertainment, since it?s conception in the beginning of the 1970?s decade. Craving to contribute to the didactical practices and pedagogical planning and strategy, this research presents reference materials to teachers, so that they can apply practices and techniques used mostly by RPG narrator?s. The terms found in the RPG books were associated to school contents, to the teacher?s pedagogical planning and to the pleasures involved in the playful practice of telling and sharing stories. It was possible to establish strong relations between the content of the game and the teachers practice, as well as to verify several points of aproximation among RPG and the educational theories, opening a wide range of options to additional researches.},

  abstract = {Popular culture media is a potent wellspring of nostalgia. From remakes and revivifications to perpetual production, aesthetics of nostalgia are commonplace among fan communities who continually encounter and experience both collective and personal pasts during engagement. Existing research has overlooked the role that fans’ gaming capital holds in the emergence of nostalgia, especially in leisure communities such as the trading card game, Magic: The Gathering. Drawing from qualitative interviews with Magic: The Gathering players in Australia, this paper applies the theory of gaming capital to illustrate how the continual acquisition of knowledge ultimately results in nostalgic attachment to times in which one knew very little. While the experience and knowledge gained by transitioning from novice to adept is seen positively, this paper argues it is nonetheless permeated by a pervading sense of loss. Paradoxically, gaming capital bifurcates into a parallel stream of value, specifically nostalgia for lost wonder and inexperience.},

The qualitative data was coded using first, second and third order coding with the use of digital coding software Atlas.ti. Of the 12 codes found from the interviews, the “Beyond Part” and the “Player versus Character” themes were examined. My analysis found that players experience the impacts of TTRPG’s beyond the table on both an individual level as well as on a group level. Furthermore the TTRPG’s help players define their identity as far as gender, sexual orientation and other personal identities such as religion. In addition to exploring identity, players also found many therapeutic aspects through the relationship between them as a player and their character. The results found in this research add to the literature exploring the impacts of TTRPG’s and are discussed in terms of their application to areas beyond the hobby as well as future research direction.},

While some literature exists linking the concepts of roleplaying to theater and psychotherapy in the pursuit of deeper game design, little exists that attempts to bridge the gap by examining the potential of role-playing games (RPGs) as therapeutic tools informed by drama therapy practices and theories. This literature review provides a brief overview of basic RPG terminology, styles, and similarities to psychodrama and theater. It also demonstrates a basic analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of four TTRPGs and LARPs as therapeutic tools through the lens of drama therapy. This literature review is in service of future research into the application of drama therapy practices to role-playing gaming, as well as into clinical game design based in therapeutic goals and structure.},

  abstract = {Objective:~           Role-playing games (RPGs) are a ludic and essentially cooperative activity performed in groups and characterized by verbal dramatization of fictional characters. The aim of this study was to identify the sociodemographic profile of tabletop RPG players and to examine the relationship between pathological game patterns among tabletop RPG players and sociodemographic characteristics, game habits, and psychopathological symptoms. Previously, research investigated the occurrence of psychopathological symptoms in RPG players, but none have investigated the relationship between pathological game patterns and psychosocial characteristics in tabletop RPG players. We hypothesize that a pathological relationship with the game is related to the players’ personal and social characteristics.           Methods:~           One hundred fifteen subjects, ages 16 to 55 years old, 92.2\% male and 7.8\% female, were accessed, and 70 participants completed self-report questionnaires on gaming behaviours and preferences, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychological symptoms.           Results:~           Having no emotional support, parents who were not interested in RPG and performing the role of player in the game were related to the high-risk group (P{$<$}0.05). No independent variables were identified for the low-risk group. All subjects in the high-risk group were also positive on the anxiety scale (P{$<$}0.05).           Conclusions:~           Personal characteristics such as having no emotional support and parents who are not interested in RPG seems to play a more important role regarding the establishment of a pathological relationship to tabletop RPG playing. Therefore, this subgroup should be carefully evaluated.           ~           Objectif:~           Les jeux de rôle (JDR) sont une activité ludique et essentiellement coopérative pratiquée en groupe et caractérisée par la mise en scène verbale de personnages fictifs. L’objectif de cette étude était d’identifier le profil sociodémographique des joueurs de JDR sur table et d’examiner la relation entre les habitudes de jeu pathologiques chez les joueurs de JDR sur table et les caractéristiques sociodémographiques, les habitudes de jeu et les symptômes psychopathologiques. Des recherches ont déjà été menées sur l’apparition de symptômes psychopathologiques chez les joueurs de JDR, mais aucune n’a étudié la relation entre les habitudes de jeu pathologiques et les caractéristiques psychosociales des joueurs de JDR sur table. Nous émettons l’hypothèse qu’une relation pathologique avec le jeu est liée aux caractéristiques personnelles et sociales des joueurs.           Méthodes:~           Cent quinze sujets, âgés de 16 à 55 ans, 92,2\% d’hommes et 7,8\% de femmes, ont été recrutés et 70 participants ont rempli des questionnaires d’auto-évaluation sur les comportements et les préférences en matière de jeu, les caractéristiques sociodémographiques et les symptômes psychologiques.           Résultats:~           L’absence de soutien émotionnel, le manque d’intérêt des parents pour le JDR et le fait de jouer le rôle de joueur dans le jeu étaient liés au groupe à haut risque (P{$<$}0,05). Aucune variable indépendante n’a été identifiée pour le groupe à faible risque. Tous les sujets du groupe à haut risque étaient également positifs sur l'échelle d’anxiété (P{$<$}0.05).           Conclusion:~           Les caractéristiques personnelles telles que l’absence de soutien émotionnel et le manque d’intérêt des parents pour les JDR semblent jouer un rôle plus important dans l'établissement d’une relation pathologique avec les JDR sur table. Par conséquent, ce sous-groupe devrait être soigneusement évalué.},

The study draws on a thematic analysis of qualitative data (N = 201) collected in April 2020, which is explored through the lens of Apperley’s (2010) theory of gaming rhythms. The results illuminate the ways in which gaming was situated in everyday life both during and before the COVID-19 restrictions, and how the pandemic and its associated restrictions disrupted, reinforced, and reconfigured the everyday rhythms of gaming. The situation impacted individuals and families differently, being beneficial to some and detrimental to others, contingent on other aspects of respondents’ lives. The results underline how an individual’s gaming does not happen in isolation, but takes place in the confines of everyday life, shaped by factors outside the individual’s control. Developing Apperley’s theory, the results show that gaming can be a very resilient activity, given the right circumstances.},

Limited research has explored the impact of tabletop roleplaying games on mental health and self-concepts such as self-esteem and self-efficacy. This study employed a repeated-measures design with four measurement points to quantitatively evaluate the effect of playing Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) on mental health and self-concepts in a community sample. Twenty-five community participants took part in 8 weeks of D\&D gameplay (one 1 hr session per week), completing pre-, mid-, and post-intervention surveys. Eighteen of these participants also completed a one-month follow up measure. Participants demonstrated significant decreases in depression, stress, and anxiety and significant increases in self-esteem and self-efficacy over the study period. As such, D\&D may have potential utility as a wellbeing intervention or prevention program.},

  abstract = {Earlier research has shown that players use roleplaying in a number of contexts to explore identity, identity performance, and to better understand their personal interactions. One place this comes into play is in games where players play the role of a character other than themselves. This thesis looks specifically at analog games and examines the way that game rules shape players’ ability to explore identity and social interaction through the game. I argue that game rules in these games help determine what questions players ask themselves and what kinds of interaction they explore. To better understand these types of games I look at the rules of a specific LARP, Dystopia Rising, and a specific tabletop game, Shadowrun, in detail in order to better understand how these rules have the potential to shape players exploration of identity and interaction.},

Aus wissenstypologischer und -soziologischer Perspektive fehlen bisher Ansätze, die uns diese Leistung verständlich machen können. Die hier vorgestellte explorative und hypothesen-generierende Studie untersucht die Weisen wie Wissen im Rollenspiel erzeugt, verwendet, verteilt und bewertet wird, und dadurch in die Konstruktion von Wirklichkeit und Fiktion in diesem Spiel eingeht – kurz: die Typen des in Rollenspielen vorkommenden Wissens. Die dafür relevanten Kategorien werden sowohl empirisch-induktiv aus qualitativen Interviews mit Rollenspielern wie auch theoretisch-deduktiv aus der bestehenden Forschungsliteratur über Rollenspiel gewonnen und in einer Proto-Theorie systematisiert. Gemäss dieser Proto-Theorie können die in Rollenspielen verwendeten Wissensinhalte unter den drei Wissens-Metatypen „Personen-Wissen“, „Rollenspieler-Wissen“ und „Charakter-Wissen“ subsumiert werden. Dies erlaubt es, das Interaktionsverhältnis formal verschiedener Wissensinhalte beim erforderlichen Aktivieren, Bewerten und Ausblenden dieses Wissens in dem komplexen Kommunikationsprozess, an dem die Teilnehmenden partizipieren, theoretisch zu erschliessen. Zudem lässt sich die Proto-Theorie empirisch anwenden, um die tatsächliche Interaktion im Rollenspiel zu analysieren und z.T. zu erklären. Diese Anwendung wird in der Studie exemplarisch anhand von transkribierten Tonband-Mitschnitten einer Rollenspielsitzung erfolgreich durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse der Studie legen nahe, dass bei dieser Interaktion ein eigentliches Wissensmanagement sowohl des Einzelnen als auch der ganzen Rollenspielergruppe erforderlich ist. Dabei spielen sowohl explizite wie auch implizite Regulierungen auf Basis zugesprochener und gewachsener Autorität und damit verbundener Legitimität des eingesetzten Wissens eine Rolle. Durch diese Aushandlungsprozesse werden zwei eigenständige Spielwirklichkeiten konstruiert – die soziale Wirklichkeit des Rollenspielens und die fiktive Wirklichkeit der Spielwelt –, die als Bezugsrahmen für sinnvolle Handlungen der Rollenspieler als Rollenspieler und als Charakter fungieren und mithin Rollenspielen überhaupt erst ermöglichen. Die in dieser Studie generierten Hypothesen dazu bilden mögliche Anknüpfungspunkte für weiterführende Forschung.},

  abstract = {In the old role-play game of Dungeons and Dragons, one rolls the dice to determine the character traits of one’s game avatar. One of the character trait rolls determines whether the avatar is Lawful (in the sense of rule-bound, consistent, and predictable) or Chaotic (in the sense of unruly, unpredictable, or inconsistent). A separate roll determines whether the avatar is Good, Evil, or Neutral. Thus, in the game, characters not only can be “lawful and good,” or “chaotic and evil,” but also “lawful and evil” or “chaotic and good.” From the usual jurisprudential standpoint, both the “lawful evil” and the “chaotic good” seem oxymoronic. We usually think that consistency and goodness go together. As Lon Fuller put it, “I shall have to rest on the assertion of a belief that may seem naïve, namely, that coherence and goodness have more affinity than coherence and evil.” From Kant’s universal principles of reason, to John Rawls’ operationalizing of Kant in his theory of the “original position,” which “generalizes and carries to a higher level of abstraction the familiar theory of the social contract,” to Ronald Dworkin’s “law as integrity” thesis that prefers the coherent interpretation to the incoherent - main-line legal theorists agree that good government ought to be coherent (lawful) and should not make ungeneralizable, un-rule-bound (chaotic) exceptions. In short, lawfulness is at least an aspect of good; unruliness is at least an aspect of evil. Political theorists have made similar points. Hannah Arendt and Lon Fuller point to Nazi Germany’s lawless use of retroactive legislation and its chaotic, opaque, and unpredictable lines of authority as essential means by which Hitler fostered fear and maintained personal control. On the other hand, the Dungeons and Dragons categories suggest that the association of lawfulness with goodness is not a logical necessity. Dolores Umbridge, Darth Vader, General Zod, and the Mayor of Pleasantville are among the classic “lawful evil” characters; Hans Solo, Captain Kirk, Robin Hood, and Mary Poppins are among the classic “chaotic good” characters.},

  abstract = {This chapter compares the experience of gaming and the experience of reading, and explores what that comparison might tell us about each. More specifically, it applies methods of literary analysis to the study of two narrative activities situated near the border of reading and gaming: Electronic hyperfictions and role-playing games. Miller first reviews literary theories of reader response and interactivity and notes how these have informed recent critical discussions of literary hyperfiction. He then critiques these discussions and the claims made for hyperfiction's liberating or empowering effect on readers: Contrary to the claims of some critics, such narratives generally fail to fulfill these promises and are, in fact, in many ways less interactive than traditional print fictions. The author then approaches the border between gaming and reading from the other direction, by examining a form of gaming that resembles reading in interesting ways: Role-playing games. Miller explores how reader response theories apply to analyzing the effects and meanings of such games, concluding that role-playing games provide a better model for the reification of reader response theories, albeit in a medium which is more oral than written, than do the hyperfictions which have received more serious attention from literary theorists. As such, role-playing games offer a potential medium for more truly interactive fiction that "serious" authors have yet to explore. Raising questions of textuality and its relation to games, Miller argues for the inclusion of games in contemporary literary studies and shows how fruitful such studies may be for our understanding of "new media" possibilities.},

  abstract = {With the prevalence of gaming among adolescents and young adults, it is essential to understand its impact on development. This study aims to facilitate development using techniques derived from Tabletop Role Playing Games (TTRPGs). This study explored the effects of role-playing activities, combined with guided character development on goal attainment. The study examined several factors of goal attainment, including motivation and self-efficacy. The study occurred over six bi-weekly one-hour-long sessions. The researcher met with the participants individually, using semi-structured open-ended question interviews and guided character-development techniques. Between each session, the participants role-played their characters. They kept a daily journal of goal-oriented activities, thoughts, and goals, which were reviewed during the bi-weekly interview and used for developing or leveling up each participant’s character. The researcher hypothesized that improvement in the character’s performance would positively impact the goal attainment and self-efficacy of the role-playing individual. The sample included five participants ranging in age from 27 to 28 years old and were recruited via flyers posted at local game stores, online gaming groups and distributed by the researcher. The results showed that utilizing areas of interest such as gaming can increase self-efficacy and goal attainment while engaging in goal-oriented activities.},

  abstract = {This account of a UK live-action roleplay (LARP) event highlights complex shifts between different interpretive frames, foregrounding the role of the physical setting as well as of non-players and locals in providing symbolic resources that inhibit or support breaking frames. The conception of framing used here draws upon and extends Goffman’s definition of a frame as part of the organization of activity that specifies meaning and expectations of involvement. In looking at the setting of such framing processes ethnographically, this article presents UK LARP as a distinctive engagement with rural materiality and a creative alternative to traditional country pursuits. From the point of view of a game organizer, the paper identifies the creation of specific contextual frames by the visiting hobbyists associated with three interpretations: 1) a narrative conception of the space as a backdrop for fantastical events, 2) a ludic conception of the space as an area of game-playing, 3) an event conception of the space and its inhabitants as something to be managed. Three examples of disruptions to the work employed to maintain these frames demonstrate the fragility of the magic involved in this fantastical hobby. © The British Association of Hand Therapists Ltd 2015.},

  abstract = {Drawing on four years of participant observation, interviews, and game recordings, this dissertation explores the collaborative experience of imagined worlds in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons \& Dragons. Research on tabletop games has at times been myopic in terms of time depth and geographic scope, and has often obscured the ethnographic realities of gaming communities. This research expands the ethnographic record on tabletop role-playing games and uses a phenomenological approach to carefully examine how gamers at five sites across the United States structure their experience of imagined worlds in the context of a productive tension between enchantment and rationalization.  After discussing the history of Dungeons \& Dragons in terms of enchantment and rationalization, the dissertation presents three case studies, each exploring a different facet of experience in imagined worlds. At a convention in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, gamers commemorate the life of Dungeons \& Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax, but also their own childhoods and a sense of a lost, imagined pre-modern world. The experience of time in the game connects that perduring world with the imagined world of the game. Having explored the relationships between commemoration, nostalgia, and the experience of imagined worlds, the dissertation moves on to consider how the imagined worlds of gaming enter the experience of players. The techniques and theories of performance utilized by a gamer in Denton, Texas portray performances in gaming, psychedelic rock, and abstract analog video art as "kidnapping reality” through the use of color, song, and choice diction to convey both affect and imaginary things into the physical spaces of her performances. The final case study considers gamers in New York City and Portland, Connecticut, where two groups have developed the imaginary worlds of their games over many years. The dissertation argues that gamers in these groups come to experience the imagined world as increasingly concrete and complex over time, and that their sustained interactions with it develop into a strong sense of what Heidegger called dwelling.},

It is a history only in a limited sense of the term. It focuses on origins, believing that what Tocqueville said of nations is also true of cultural phenomena such as games: “[T]hey all bear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied their birth and contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their being” (Tocqueville 17). Dungeons and Dragons is primarily considered in terms of Max Weber’s discussion of the protestant ethic and the irrationality of rationality; concurrently, this article also demonstrates the utility of D\&D as a means to explore any number of cultural and social questions. The productive tension between rationality and enchantment identified in D\&D has broad-reaching implications for understanding other areas of culture to which Weberian ideas are more typically applied.},

Whereas previously “space was treated as static, neutral, transparent, and hence theoretically uninteresting,” many theorists have begun to explore the constructed nature of both space and place, the relationship between the two, and the relationship of both to issues of power and identity (Feld and Basso 1996; Lefebvre 1976; Soja 1980; Tuan 1977).  It is perhaps ironic that in game studies, where the spaces are more obviously constructed, little seems to have been written about the ways and ends to which players create and sustain imaginary spaces.  In this paper I explore the creation of space in Dungeons \& Dragons, a case study I consider in the context of Gabbert's (2007) study of McCall, Iowa and Basso's (1996) study of the Western Apache.  Aligning these three studies allows each of them to nuance and illuminate one another, creating a complex picture of the human experience of space and place.},

  abstract = {The modern consumer has access to a massively complex entertainment world. Many of the products available reveal a visible movement of popular fantasy worlds between different media. This transmedia process creates a strong link between film, merchandising and games; with all of these mediums borrowing from each other. This borrowing takes various forms, from licensed adaptations to unofficial copying of ideas, settings and characters as well as exploiting the different aesthetics and techniques of different media. Much of the scholarship on transmedia concentrates on storytelling, where a single overarching narrative unfolds over several different media. This thesis will move away from storytelling to consider how culture producers borrow the aesthetics, narratives and fantasy worlds from other sources, including computer games. This borrowing happens because it enables them to use transmedia functionality to gain market share from an already established audience who have a vested interested in, and enthusiasm for, an established world. Most of this borrowing happens around specific genres – especially fantasy, science fiction and horror. These genres are particularly wide-ranging and emphasise the possibilities of worldbuilding, making then good sources for multi-media franchises. This thesis will examine examples from these genres to examine what elements are translated to a new medium, and what is discarded. This examination will help explain how and why different media and settings work in the way that they do.},

It also outlines research made on those games, and it comments on changing cultural and political factors shaping the development of Polish history/heritage-themed games over the last three decades. We group the games in thematic-chronological categories: early medieval Slavic settings up to 1000, medieval to Renaissance Poland, and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1569–1795. Main findings: (a) Slavic fantasy became very popular with game developers after Witcher 3, but it has received little scholarly attention beside the witcher series. (b) Medieval Polish monarchies have barely caught the eye of game developers, which translates to the absence of related research. (c) The PLC period is well-represented in digital and nondigital games, and well-researched in historical games studies by Polish scholars in Polish and English.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the evolution of larp safety in the Nordic-American larp community in the last decade, tracing the correlation between safety rhetorics (opinions, arguments, and policies) and mechanics (explicit rules regulating player interactions). It appears that up to around 2010 there was a general acceptance of risk, with a significant share of responsibility for risk identification and harm prevention put on the player. This correlates with mechanics such as safety words, which expected players in distress to actively signal their discomfort. Safety measures expected from the organisers consisted mainly in providing safe off-game spaces, emotional support, and intervention whenever something harmful happened. Around 2014 the safety debate put a larger share of responsibility on players initiating potentially troubling interactions. This correlates with the ‘OK check’ mechanics which requires communication between the initiator and the target of such interactions. Around 2016 the safety debate moved to the position in which it requires organisers and participants to do their best to prevent harm from ever happening. This finds its expression in the rapidly expanding toolkit of mechanics of consent and calibration, which clearly put responsibility for overstepping someone’s boundaries on the one who oversteps. To simplify, the first approach obliged players and organisers to taking care of those who signalled they needed it. The second approach required caution and care in testing someone’s boundaries. The last one states that boundaries are to be carefully identified and respected – not tested.},

  abstract = {Role-play as a Heritage Practice is the first book to examine physically performed role-enactments, such as live-action role-play (LARP), tabletop role-playing games (TRPG), and hobbyist historical reenactment (RH), from a combined game studies and heritage studies perspective.  Demonstrating that non-digital role-plays, such as TRPG and LARP, share many features with RH, the book contends that all three may be considered as heritage practices. Studying these role-plays as three distinct genres of playful, participatory and performative forms of engagement with cultural heritage, Mochocki demonstrates how an exploration of the affordances of each genre can be valuable. Showing that a player’s engagement with history or heritage material is always multi-layered, the book clarifies that the layers may be conceptualised simultaneously as types of heritage authenticity and as types of in-game immersion. It is also made clear that RH, TRPG and LARP share commonalities with a multitude of other media, including video games, historical fiction and film. Existing within, and contributing to, the fiction and non-fiction mediasphere, these role-enactments are shaped by the same large-scale narratives and discourses that persons, families, communities, and nations use to build memory and identity. Role-play as a Heritage Practice will be of great interest to academics and students engaged in the study of heritage, memory, nostalgia, role-playing, historical games, performance, fans and transmedia narratology.},

  abstract = {Background In this paper, we explore the potential of games to collect empirical data for informing agent-based simulation models of migration. To examine the usefulness of game-based approaches, we conducted a simple, yet carefully designed psychological experiment. Methods In a preregistered study, we used a novel, immersive experimental setting to investigate the risky migration decisions made by migrants and non-migrants. Participants (284 migrants and 284 non-migrants) played a choice-based interactive fiction game—a fully text-based game where players progress by selecting from a list of possible actions—that involved making three risky migration decisions. In one condition, participants were shown a non-linear progress bar and explicit acknowledgements of the choices they made to promote perceived agency: the feeling that one’s actions have a non-trivial impact on the game. In the other condition, the progress bar was linear, and the explicit acknowledgements were omitted. Results Our experimental manipulation was successful; participants in the former condition self-reported higher perceived agency than participants in the latter condition, as did migrants compared to non-migrants. Nevertheless, condition and migrant status did not meaningfully affect the risky migration decisions participants made in the game. Conclusion These findings indicate that the results of generic studies on risky migration decisions conducted on non-migrants can potentially inform simulation models of migration. However, these findings were obtained from a single experiment, and thus warrant replication and further research before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Furthermore, a simple text-based game may be too superficial to allow deep insights into the idiosyncrasies of migration decision-making. This suggests a possible trade-off between clear interpretability of the results and the usefulness for informing simulation models of complex social processes, such as migration.},

Most often dice are used for this, but a few games use cards, rock-paperscissors or other means of randomization. There are dozens of different ways dice have been used in RPGs, and we are likely to see many more in the future. This is not an evolution from bad methods to better methods – there is no such thing as a perfect dice-roll system suitable for all games (though there are methods that are suitable for none). But how will a designer be able to decide which of the existing dice-roll method is best suited for his game, or when to invent his own? There is no recipe for doing this – it is in many ways an art. But like any art, there is an element of craft involved. This paper will attempt to provide some tools and observations that, hopefully, will give the reader some tools for the craftmanship involved in the art of choosing or designing dice-roll mechanisms for RPGs.},

  abstract = {Role-playing games (RPG's) use a variety of methods for rolling dice to add randomness to the game. In the simplest form, a small number of identical dice are rolled and added, but more advanced forms involve cumulative re-rolling of 6's, doubling the value of doubles, removing the lowest or highest result or counting the number of dice that are below a threshold, and many other weird and wonderful modifications. While die-roll programs and net-based die-roll servers exist, they can usually only handle the simplest form of die-rolls. This paper describes Roll, a simple functional language for defining how dice are rolled. Such definitions are then used to emulate die-rolls or make probability calculations. We describe two different semantics for Roll: One that corresponds to randomly rolling the dice and one for calculating the probability distribution. We discuss implementation issues regarding the latter.},

  abstract = {Dice are used in many games, and often in fairly complex ways that make it difficult to unambiguously describe the dice-roll mechanism in plain language. Many role-playing games, such as Dungeons \& Dragons, use a formalised notation for some instances of dice-rolls. This notation, once explained, make dice-roll descriptions concise and unambiguous. Furthermore, the notation has been used in automated tools for pseudo-random dice-rolling (typically used when playing over the Internet). This notation is, however, fairly limited in the types of dice-rolls it can describe, so most games still use natural language to describe rolls. Even Dungeons \& Dragons use formal notation only for some of the dice-roll methods used in the game. Hence, a more complete notation is in this paper proposed, and a tool for pseudo-random rolls and (nearly) exact probability calculations is described. The notation is called "Troll", combining the initial of the Danish word for dice ("terninger") with the English word "roll". It is a development of the language Roll described in an earlier paper. The present paper describes the most important features of Troll and its implementation.},

He then considers the introduction of commercial interactive fiction for home computers, particularly that produced by Infocom. Commercial works inspired an independent reaction, and Montfort describes the emergence of independent creators and the development of an online interactive fiction community in the 1990s. Finally, he considers the influence of interactive fiction on other literary and gaming forms.

  abstract = {On the Edge of the Magic Circle studies two threads of contemporary  western gaming culture: Role-playing and pervasive games. Recreational  role-playing includes forms such as tabletop role-playing games, larps  and online role-playing games, while pervasive games range from treasure  hunts to alternate reality games. A discussion on pervasive role-playing  connects these strands together. The work has four larger research goals. First, to establish a  conceptual framework for understanding role-playing in games. Second, to  establish a conceptual framework for understanding pervasive games.  Third, to explore the expressive potential of pervasive games through  prototypes. And fourth, to establish a theoretical foundation for the  study of ephemeral games. The central outcome of the work is a theory complex that explains and  defines role-playing and pervasive gaming, and allows them to be  understood in the context of the recent discussion in game studies. In order to understand these two borderline cases of games, the work  establishes a theoretical foundation that highlights gameplay as a  social process. This foundation combines the weak social constructionism  of John R. Searle with the recent game studies scholarship from authors  such as Jesper Juul, Jane McGonigal, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman. Työssä etsitään vastauksia neljään laajaan tutkimuskysymykseen. Ensinnäkin, työ pyrkii esittämään käsitteellisen kehyksen, jolla voidaan ymmärtää eri pelien puitteissa tapahtuvaa roolipelaamista. Toiseksi, työ esittää käsitteellisen kehyksen arkeen sulautuvien pelien ymmärtämiseksi. Kolmanneksi, työssä tutkitaan prototyyppien avulla arkeen sulautuvien pelien ilmaisullista potentiaalia. Ja neljänneksi, työssä luodaan teoreettista pohjaa häviävien pelien tutkimiseksi. Työn keskeisin tulos on teoriamalli, jolla voidaan ymmärtää roolipelaamista ja arkeen sulautuvia pelejä viimeaikaisen pelitutkimuksen kontekstissa. Tällaisten pelien rajatapausten ymmärtämiseksi työ on rakennettu perustalle, jossa pelaamisen luonnetta sosiaalisena prosessina korostetaan. Tässä perustassa yhdistetään John R. Searlen heikkoa sosiaalista konstruktionismia mm. Jesper Juulin, Jane McGonigalin, Katie Salenin ja Eric Zimmermanin poikkitieteelliseen pelitutkimukseen.},

Even though the games successfully produce unpleasant experiences, they gratify their target group of experienced role-players. Almost all of the sixteen interviewed players appreciated their experiences, despite crying, experiencing physiological stress reactions and feeling generally ‘bad’ during play. It was also found out that players feel intimately connected after play, and felt the need for thorough debriefing afterwards. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Dans l’arbre généalogique des jeux vidéo, les livres-jeux sont des maillons qui sont souvent négligés. Pourtant, ces récits à embranchements ont de nombreux points communs avec certains genres de jeux vidéo qui mettent l’accent sur les choix significatifs du joueur et sur l’impact qu’ils ont sur la ligne narrative et l’univers de fiction. Le concept d’expérientialité, issu de la narratologie cognitive, permet d’éclairer le fonctionnement commun à ces deux formats : si le propre d’un récit est de se construire autour d’une expérience subjective inscrite dans le temps, il découle qu’un récit disjonctif tendra naturellement à se construire autour de la notion du libre-arbitre. La mise en scène du choix et de son impact est à ce titre plus importante que la réelle marge de manœuvre laissée au joueur : c’est le ressenti expérientiel qui prime dans cette narrativité du choix., In the family tree of video games, gamebooks are often overlooked. Yet these arborescent narratives have much in common with certain types of video games that emphasize the significant choices made by the player and the impact they have on the storyline and the fictional universe. The concept of experientiality, as developed by cognitive narratology, may help to clarify the mechanisms shared by these two formats : if narratives are built around a subjective experience unfolding through time, then the natural tendency of disjunctive narratives will be to build themselves around the notion of free will. In this regard, the staging of choice and of its impact is more important than the actual degree of leeway left to the player : the experiential aspects are paramount in this narrativity of choice.},

And second, what are the effects of salient decision points (narrative controls) on the player perception of narrative structure and complexity as well as control over the player-character? Does higher perceived complexity lead to heightened effectence and Flow? To what extent are these effects context-dependent in terms of narrative feedback mechanisms and overall structure? Two hypotheses were developed based on prior research: 1. Branching narrative in an RPG leads to improved game play experiences compared to linear narrative and 2. Presence of salient decision points in a RPG leads to improved experiences of game play. A 2x2 factorial experiment was conducted to test these hypotheses.},

However, no empirical study has been conducted to validate these statements. This research attempts to fill in this gap. Two hypotheses were developed based on prior research. In a controlled experiment, participants were asked to view prerecorded game play sessions based on which participant experiences were assessed. The experiment suggests that both narrative structure and number of salient decision points impact on game play experience of RPGs.},

Although, D\&D is primarily a game that uses physical components such as paper character sheets or dice, technology has also found its way to it, which is no surprise because current world is full of new technologies. The aim of this work is to examine the motivation of players to play, what role mediation plays, what technologies are used in playing and what are the main differences players perceive in the case of face-to-face session and in the case of online session. Many different technologies are used in both cases. Research questions dealing with these topics are answered through semi-structured interviews with a total of eight players and two participant observations of a player group's session. The most important reasons to play are the social and creative aspects of the game - players play with others, with whom they often form long-term friendships, and enjoy creating and using their imagination to create unique characters, narratives and worlds. D\&D is also a source of inspiration for them. The main differences in offline and online game are especially in sociality and opportunities for communication, which is related to the atmosphere and experience, which in the case of face-to-face game...},

For example, digital role-play games often engage individual students at a computer, rather than creating rich social interactions among students. To design interactions that better support the core aspects of classroom role-play, we conducted interviews with teachers. We also interviewed role-play gamers to discover how traditional RPG techniques and technology can be used to enhance classroom role-play. The purposes of this study were to: (i) explore the reasons instructors choose role-play for learning, such as giving students practice opportunities; (ii) identify barriers to instructors using classroom role-play activities, such as time constraints and student discomfort; (iii) report issues around integrating technology, such as the benefit of reducing cognitive load and the threat of distraction; and (iv) highlight two areas where insights from role-playing games can support the design of effective interactive learning systems for classroom role-play, namely by providing methods for emphasizing group success over individual achievement and by preserving the spirit of the experience.},

The fandom being examined here is devoted to the Cthulhu Mythos, a series of short interwoven sci-fi horror stories about monstrous alien gods and their dealings with human beings. Born of the pen of pulp author H.P. Lovecraft during the 1920s, this unique brand of "cosmic horror" survived its author's death by continually mutating to this day, attracting a wide ranging group of individuals who have "consecrated themselves" to Lovecraft's literary legacy and "long for the return of the monster gods" he dreamed up.},

The existing literature on emergent narrative primarily focuses on video games and Avant Garde texts but tabletop role-playing games provide a novel opportunity to explore emergent narrative in new ways. The dynamic of a collaborative game with multiple players and a gamemaster provides additional challenges for designers due to variance in interpretation of the game events and the lack of a digital program to handle inputs and outputs but simultaneously provides incredible opportunity for player autonomy with the constraints of programming absent in this analog form of game. This project examines existing literature on emergent narrative and ludology, identifies key concepts from said literature, then discusses the process of applying those concepts to the adventure zine that was created as a component of this project. Previous literature on emergent narrative has examined existing games and texts and drawn conclusions from those works, this project endeavors to invert this process by applying previously drawn conclusions to the creation of the new work of fiction that is the adventure zine, this application demonstrating the strength of those conclusions as well as providing new insights on how emergent narrative functions in tabletop role-playing games.},

  abstract = {Roleplaying Games and Performance calls to mind popular appearances of roleplaying games on stage and screen, like Stranger Things or Qui Nguyen’s popular play, She Kills Monsters. However, inquiry into the way roleplaying games appear in these titles reveals the way they have been instrumentalized to serve the ends of their respective mediums. Scholars writing about roleplaying games also tend to leap straight to analyses of video games, with many words spilled over World of Warcraft while a live site of analog performance sits before them. In this work, I address the tabletop roleplaying game as a medium with insights to offer Theatre and Performance Studies as an object of study. In this dissertation, I explore the way that tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) use speech and performance to guide players through conventional practices that allow them to imagine together, safely and respectfully. Here, I show that TTRPGs are a medium whose performance shares many qualities with Theatre. Through these qualities, I construct a framework through which I unpack the event of play, its participants, and the conventions that shepherd it. Interpreting roleplaying as the performance of a series of speech acts, I draw attention to the conventions that allow us to collaborate and imagine together through play. Analyzing on the design of these conventions across a wide variety of these games, I show the way the system of rules created by game designers render explicit the implied social conventions that govern conversation and social interaction. These games design their rules to structure the relationships between players and create tools to promote respectful interaction at the table. This underscores the importance of this site not only for scholarship, but also for practice and pedagogy. Safety tools and the distribution of narrative authority do not merely show that players collaborate, communicate boundaries, and act respectfully and with consent – they show us how. By unpacking rules about safety and consent, and by putting them into practice, theatre practitioners gain a new understanding of what we make, how we work together, and how to move through a social world with safety and respect.},

Due to the highly narrative component of this game, D\&D and many other interactive games represent a challenging setting for the Natural Language Generation (NLG) capabilities of LLMs. This paper explores using LLMs to generate new spells, which are one of the most captivating aspects of D\&D gameplay. Due to the scarcity of resources available for such a specific task, we build a dataset of 3,259 instances by combining official and fan-made D\&D spells. We considered several LLMs in generating spells, which underwent a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Metrics including Bleu and BertScore were computed for quantitative assessments. Subsequently, we also conducted an in-vivo evaluation with a survey involving D\&D players, which could assess the quality of the generated spells as well as their adherence to the rules. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the open-sourcing of all models, datasets, and findings, aiming to catalyze further research on this topic.},

  abstract = {Jouer à l’école, est-ce bien raisonnable ? Bien souvent, le jeu se fait rare après l’école maternelle, pour ne surgir à nouveau que le dernier jour avant la sortie des classes... comme si ce n’était déjà plus l’école et que l’on pouvait donc s’amuser un peu. Et pourtant... De nombreux travaux de recherche éclairent la place spécifique et le rôle original du jeu dans le processus d’apprentissage. Des enseignants utilisent des jeux de plateaux ou des jeux de rôle, et sont sollicités pour recourir au jeu vidéo en classe : la pratique du jeu dans le cadre extrascolaire a contribué dans le même temps à poser à nouveau la question de l’utilisation au service de l’acquisition de connaissances et de compétences. La définition, la place et le rôle du jeu à l’école ont une histoire longue et contrastée. Des initiatives variées, individuelles ou institutionnelles, ont été prises dans différents systèmes éducatifs : « jouer » à l’école est possible. Les enseignants qui intègrent le jeu sous une forme ou une autre ne sont pas forcément joueurs eux-mêmes : c’est l’impact positif du jeu sur la motivation et sur les apprentissages qui les a générale- ment convaincus de tenter l’expérience. Jeux dramatiques et jeux de rôle favorisent en effet la motivation des élèves, servent de levier aux apprentissages et sont des outils précieux dans une approche de l’enseignement orientée vers le développement de compétences. La connaissance des processus cognitifs plaide pour l’utilisation de jeux en classe, re- posant ou non sur un support informatique. Loin de pouvoir se passer de l’enseignant, le jeu éducatif exige de ce dernier qu’il « joue son rôle », rôle en partie redéfini par la configuration du jeu. Qu’il participe ou non à sa conception, l’enseignant conserve une place déterminante car, dans une visée pédagogique en relation avec le curriculum, le jeu n’est pas une fin en soi. Il doit y avoir un avant-jeu et un après-jeu pour favoriser l’analyse réflexive et les « compétences méta ». Ce dossier propose d’explorer ce renouveau dans les relations entre jeu et école, à travers une revue de la littérature scientifique récente, en France et à l’étranger.},

Both lead me to a life of convention, simply living up to the code of conduct given by society. It is much more comfortable to think of evil as something done by villains in movies. There is something rather disturbing about the thought that one can become evil gradually. Because of the influence of bad habits, much about the moral life feels grey and fuzzy.},

  abstract = {Deep generative models are currently the leading method for algorithmic music composition. However, one of the major problems of this method consists of controlling the trained models to generate compositions with given characteristics. This dissertation explores how to control deep generative models to compose music with a target emotion. Given the limitation of labeled data, this dissertation focuses on search-based methods that use a music emotion classifier to steer the distribution of a pre-trained musical language model. Three different search-based approaches have been proposed. The first one is a genetic algorithm to optimize a language model towards a given sentiment. The second one is a decoding algorithm, called Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search (SBBS), which controls the language model at generation time. The third method is also a decoding algorithm but based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. SBBS has been applied to generate background music for tabletop roleplaying games, matching the emotion of the story being told by the players. A dataset of symbolic piano music called VGMIDI has been created to support the work in this dissertation. VGMIDI currently has 200 pieces labeled according to the circumplex model of emotion, and an additional 3,640 unlabelled pieces. The three methods were evaluated with listening tests, in which human subjects indicated that the methods could convey different target emotions.},

This study is meant as an examination of the role of audience and narrator in Dungeons \& Dragons and the game’s narrative elements using the lenses of Wayne Booth’s theories on the narrator as stated in his book The Rhetoric of Fiction and Joseph Campbell’s theory on the monomyth, or the “hero’s journey”, as stated in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. While Dungeons \& Dragons has been studied for its psychological and philosophical qualities, very little research has been conducted on the game’s literary qualities and its relationship between the author and their audience. This thesis serves a jumping-off point into an area of study that is ripe with topics and themes to be studied.},

  abstract = {Post-colonial scholarship on Tabletop RPGs observes a clear problem with Dungeons \& Dragons; that its system, setting, and rules utilize and reinforce colonial frameworks, primarily race and civilization, for the purpose of entertainment and storytelling. Developing fields of scholarship on Tabletop RPGs, however, emphasize the ability of Tabletop RPGs to inspire critical thinking and challenge pre-conceived ideas that players accept about race, identity, and culture. This disconnect is in part due to the narrow focus on Dungeons \& Dragons as the primary, if not sole, system put to analysis. This thesis begins by committing a different system, Greg Stafford’s RuneQuest, to analysis, with the goal of analyzing the discourses of imperialism present within RuneQuest’s primary narrative of the Hero Wars. Utilizing the British conceptions of liberty provided by Thomas Carlyle and John Stuart Mill, the ways in which the Lunar Empire and the Kingdom of Sartar undermine their own conceptions of liberty become clear. In combination with the indeterminate telos of the Hero Wars, and the deconstructive properties of mysticism that drive the Hero Wars, RuneQuest demonstrates resistance to the idea of a transcendental signified, and thereby engenders decolonization through instability of meaning.},

Online resources can facilitate this process, by placing individuals in contact with a wider network of fellow hobbyists, but the limited channel of communication available online also restricts the social cues that could otherwise contribute to learning.},

Thus, we examine the capabilities of several models on the task of generating new content for this game, evaluating the performance through the use of both score-based methods and a survey on the best performing model to determine how the generated content conforms to the rules of the game and how well they might be used in the game.},

In that case, the philosophers should expect the relationship between game designer and player to map onto the familiar relationship between artist and audience. Designers hoped to create mechanics that would support collaborative storytelling, player creativity, and narrative improvisation. And the improvisations are still constrained by the rules – since players still have to follow the rules and roll for their various attempts inside the flashbacks. Those rolls create quite a bit of emergent chaos, which conditions further creativity. Players are playing to find out, to discover, how history goes – and they find those answers in their own collaborative improvisation, as guided by the directive to fit it into the bits of history that they have already previously improvised. Player-centric games typically create enormous room for player agency and creativity, and encourage rich improvisations as part of play.},

One might even see gaming as an attempt to find friends and build that political community of which Aristotle says friendship is the root. The really interesting thing about gamers is that, as they play Dungeons Dragons, they at one and the same time build bonds between their characters and between each other as players. The trajectory of these bonds often mirrors the trajectory of friendships we find in epic fantasy literature where the characters, at first suspicious of each other, in the end have developed true friendships and established peaceful kingdoms where chaos had reigned before. Aristotle's philosophy of friendship can help us to understand this development. Dungeons Dragons players know a lot about friendship and the value of friendship in a person's life, despite the popular depiction of gamers.},

In recent times, the evolution of the imaginary worlds found in speculative works of fiction appears to favour diversity and inclusiveness, keeping in touch with wider societal trends. This transition in fantastic chronotopes is extensively chronicled in the genre of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, or TRPGs for short. The present paper aims to examine the evolution of fantastical landscapes within the very influential TRPG genre through the combined framework of narrative and cultural theories. The settings of the most successful TRPGs, Dungeons and Dragons and World of Darkness, will serve as examples.

  abstract = {Originating in classic fantasy literature and pulp fantasy magazines, the increasingly influential genre of Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs) contains multiple problematic elements in its treatment of race, gender and sexual orientation. This essay investigates whether TRPG participants in the early twenty-first century perpetuate established tropes, or whether they take advantage of the genre’s postmodern qualities in order to engage in practices of negotiation, subversion and eventual transgression. The subversive potential of TRPGs is examined through a framework which combines narrative studies with cultural studies and the analysis of two case studies. The trans-textual and transmedial examination conducted on the two most influential TRPGs, Dragons \& Dragons and World of Darkness, has revealed that TRPGs narratives are constantly evolving to reflect cultural shifts. Studying TRPGs, can illuminate certain aspects of cultural evolution and shed light on the evolution of speculative fiction in the post-postmodern world.},

By exploring the various applications of the hugely popular tabletop role-playing game, there are several aspects in which students and teachers can explore in order to find practical as well as theoretical uses for a role-playing game of this size and scope. This study has discussed and analyzed the benefits and drawbacks of implementing Dungeons \& Dragons in the EFL classroom through mental imagery and immersion as an effective teaching tool. The implementation of D\&D in an EFL classroom is achievable through scaffolding and preparation. This study has also discussed the gamification aspects of the EFL classroom and the game specific areas of game-based pedagogy.},

Après cinq décennies de création, le jeu de rôle semble connaître un nouveau souffle aussi bien en termes de publics, que de pratiques, de contenus et d’influences.    Dans le prolongement du colloque « Vous êtes dans une taverne... Retour sur 50 ans de Jeu de rôle » (Université de Lorraine, Metz, 27-28 mars 2024), et dans l’esprit des colloques organisés à l’Université Paris Nord en 2015 pour les quarante ans du jeu de rôle puis en 2017, cet évènement est l’occasion de rassembler des chercheuses et des chercheurs de différents domaines et spécialités, mais aussi des autrices et des auteurs, des créatrices et des créateurs, ainsi que toutes les actrices et les acteurs œuvrant dans le milieu du jeu de rôle (éditions, vidéastes « youtube », associations, fédérations, etc.), et passionné·e·s de jeux de rôle, avec pour objectif de cartographier le paysage rôliste 50 ans après l’invention du medium.    Qu’il s’agisse de séries, de films, de littérature, de musique, de jeux de plateau ou de jeux vidéo, le jeu de rôle s’est largement implanté dans le paysage ludique et culturel, et de nouvelles formes de pratiques, en ligne par exemple, viennent aujourd’hui l’enrichir et le complexifier.    Sans être exhaustifs, 4 axes thématiques viennent questionner la pratique du jeu de rôle aujourd’hui :        Game Design et théories du jeu de rôle : de nouveaux dispositifs ? De nouveaux récits ?      Pratiques et expériences : de nouvelles façons de jouer ?      Représentation et médiation : un nouveau regard sur le jeu de rôle ?      Sociologie des joueurs : de nouveaux publics ? Le retour du jeu de rôle ?},

  abstract = {The skill of calling animals to fight brings up unique ethical questions. Mages usually interact with animals in two ways: First, the author can summon animals by using animal-summoning or monster-summoning spells. Second, a mage can summon animals to be familiar. A familiar was once a normal animal that has been transformed into magical beast with unique powers and abilities. Bats, cats, hawks, and rats are examples of common familiar companions. The rights ethicist Tom Regan argues that animals have particular rights because they are subjects of a life, meaning that they seek to satisfy specific preferences and interests. As Lord Acton wrote, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” It appears that this also holds in Dungeons Dragons (DD). Thus, when playing a character who can summon nonhuman animals, it may be wise to take the ethics into account when deciding what actions are best.},

This project strives to categorize some of the techniques used in the classroom as role playing in their own right. The purpose of all gamification, role playing and SEL, and the satanic panic that came out against Dungeons \& Dragons are looked at. This paper additionally looks at some examples of role playing in the classroom that have succeeded at a small charter school in Minneapolis. These findings underscore the equity achieved by allowing for student choice when planning how they will show their mastery of what we are working on. In addition, this practice allows students to work on something they care about, which evens the playing field for all parties involved.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to provide a role-playing game system that combines gamification, role-playing teaching techniques and tabletop RPGs to be used in teaching, in an effort to increase student involvement. The main theory behind it is Content Gamification (which focuses on making a module’s content more fun), and tabletop role-playing games combined with rules from the “Betrayal at the house on the hill” board game. The framework itself is called “Code-Playing Technique” and it directly combines physical role-play and learning programming. This is a learning technique designed for use in Software Engineering and Game Programming curricula. With the “Code-Playing Technique”, students may express themselves through coding instead of via words or natural language. As such, during role-playing a character in a virtual setting, anything that the player does and anything that happens to that character must be expressed through programming and scripting from within a game engine. While this paper explores the CodePlay framework itself, the complementary paper “The Blackthorn Manor: A Case Study in Teaching Software Engineering for Computer Games Courses using CodePlay Framework” applies it in a university module.},

  abstract = {In recent years, educators have become increasingly interested in improving methods in order to engage students and enrich their learning experiences. With technology's continual advancement, educators are recognizing the effectiveness of Game-Based Learning in enhancing student learning. This paper aims to identify and highlight the key role-playing elements that foster student engagement in the classroom, proposing strategies to enhance educational games through these elements. A qualitative research study was made with a semi-systematic literature review and the use of the Minequest game prototype, which includes 9 of 10 RPG elements identified in this paper. Thirteen students have participated in this study and overall results show that they have found the game prototype engaging, but not educational enough only by itself. Therefore, it could be better if similar educational games with role-playing elements were used as a complement to conventional teaching methods.},

The consequences of the decision are not unproblematic. The public debate, as well as research, shows that parents have a problem seeing how their style of parenting could correlate with the Convention’s legal text. The parents express hopelessness towards the notion of child upbringing. This thesis is an exploratory pilot study aiming to prepare and generate new knowledge for a project commissioned by Save the Children with the goal to develop a game to decrease the knowledge gap between parents and children regarding what the Convention means for their relationship. The thesis also asks the question: how can a game, played by parents and children meant to teach them about soft values in accordance with the Convention look like. Beyond traditional qualitative research methods, this thesis used Research through Design and developed a presumptive prototype for the project in order to explore the research subject. Findings showed that the games narrative and the power to change the narrative through player choices play an essential part in the participant’s ability to immerse in the game, and that this interactive narrative is closely connected with the ability to learn. The thesis also shows designer directions to consider when developing a game meant to teach the players about soft values.},

  abstract = {Many tabletop RPG players believe that gamemasters – the persons controlling the storyworld of a role-playing game – have a huge amount of responsibility on handling the issues rising within the communities and the problems coming up during play. What are the types of problems that gamemasters face while running games? How do they handle these problems when they do arise? This research set out to answer these questions by applying thematic analysis on a data set collected from 41 Vampire TRPG gamemasters with an online questionnaire.     The results show that there are many types of problems that a gamemaster can face while running their game, including differences in creative agendas; difficult social dynamics; problems in power sharing and problems with bleed – the crossover between character and player. It is also presented that gamemasters use multiple tactics to ensure a safer and more enjoyable game for all participants. These included calibrations, which could be related to the exogenous, endogenous or diegetic frames of the game; directing, which focused on the the diegetic frame of the game and aftercare, which was used to prevent problems in social dynamics after the game, and to facilitate the changing of frames between game and “real life.”      I argue that while gamemasters do have a rather comprehensive understanding of safety, consent and boundary setting, a deeper understanding on the cultural issues affecting the gendered nature of power, emotions and bleed is required, as well as studies on the experiences of players. I also point out that there is indeed a small minority of tabletop gamers that still appear to feel threatened by safety mechanics and by studies such as this.},

  abstract = {With the spread of smartphones and computer games, concerns have escalated regarding the rising prevalence of gaming disorder. Patients often display attentional biases, unconsciously turning their attention towards gaming-related stimuli. However, attempts to discover and ameliorate these attentional deficits have yielded inconsistent outcomes, potentially due to the dynamic nature of attentional bias. This study investigated neural mechanisms underlying attentional bias state by combining neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging -fMRI) with an approach-avoidance task tailored to an individual’s gaming preference. We conducted a multivariate pattern analysis of endogenous brain activity in 21 participants with probable gaming disorder. Our analyses revealed that activity patterns in the insula tracked temporal attentional bias states specific to gaming stimuli. A broad network of frontal and parietal regions instead appeared to predict a general temporal attentional bias state. Finally, we conducted a proof-of-concept study for ‘just-in-time’ attentional bias training through fMRI-decoded neurofeedback of insula activity patterns, named decoded attentional bias training (DecABT). Our preliminary results suggest that DecABT may help to decrease the attractiveness of gaming stimuli via a insula- and precuneus-based neural mechanism. This work provides new evidence for the insula as an endogenous regulator of attentional bias states in gaming disorder and a starting point to develop novel, individualized therapeutic approaches to treat addiction. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Neurofeedback: new territories and neurocognitive mechanisms of endogenous neuromodulation’.},

  abstract = {The games are artistic, aesthetic, interdisciplinary, a hybrid, poly and metamorphic field   that involve scriptable navigability programming, interface design, animation techniques,   usability. This is a research work carried out in the Post Graduate Program in Education   (PPGE / UFT). The objective was to understand the role that RPG games play in the   contemporary cyber world, as well as their academic production in Brazil. Currently, games   are characterized by their intermediary nature, that is, the conversation of games with other   media, such as films. Based on this assumption, we conducted a Bibliographical Research   for theoretical review, presenting important aspects of the history of RPG in Brazil and in   the world. Another step was to relate RPG to education. Our research problem was   delimited around the question: what research has been developed in Brazil? What   discussion can we take from the initial observation of the research data? The theoretical   framework was based on contributions from Cognitive Linguistics (JOHNSON, 1987;  CREPALDE, 2014) and Complex Thinking (EDGAR MORIN, 1995, 2007), and on works   on RPG and Games (SARAH BOWMAN, 2017), (EDSON CUPERTINO, 2008),   (WAGNER SCHIMIT, 2008), (JOSÉ P. ZAGAL; SEBASTIAN DETERDING, 2018),   (LÚCIA SANTAELLA, 2007). Our results indicate that without an observation of the   parameters that make up, or rather, the mechanisms of RPG and its in-depth study can lead   to configuring RPG as a false novelty, despite its liquid languages. Finally, we reflect   briefly on what we call the potentialities of RPG that determine basic paths for the   epistemological discussion of the present research object.},

  abstract = {Identity Performativity theory is relatively new to the field of linguistics and as such has been the subject of a growing number of research in linguistics. Most popularly, focus on performativity has been the discursive construction of gendered identity/identities. Though a number of studies have sought to examine the role language performance plays in construction, a surprising few have aimed to look at activities focused on the intentional creation and maintenance of identities in a specifically performative context such as: improvisational acting and roleplaying games. This study uses a social constructionist framework through discourse analysis to examine a community of practice centered around the performance of multiple roles during a 9 hour session of Dungeons and Dragons, a tabletop roleplaying game, in order to see what strategies players employed to call out specific gendered roles and what those strategies might assume about identity construction. Primarily, how does language choice illustrate the theory that identity is not only co-constructed, but that each person embodies a series of sometimes conflicting gender identities that are often contested? The results of the research show evidence that each person constructs for themselves and others not one, but multiple, identities in the course of conversation and often for different purposes.},

  abstract = {Role-playing games (RPGs) such as Dungeons \& Dragons are an ideal means of communicative language teaching (CLT) due to the central role of contextual learning, negotiation of meaning, and collaborative learning in their play. However, existing RPGs can be difficult to incorporate into the Spanish-language classroom due to several factors. Among these is the high cost of entry to learn the game’s rules and the frequent necessity to assign a dungeon master/game master to lead the party. RPGs often require extended periods of play and can be comprised of many sessions in a campaign. Furthermore, there are a limited number of Spanish-language RPGs, which makes it difficult to discover pre-existing RPGs appropriate for the Spanish-language classroom. In this presentation, I will introduce an original RPG tailored to language teaching. Full playthrough consists of a single session, completable in under one hour with no dungeon master/game master. Sessions are scaffolded through a shared plan that the students create together before roleplaying as individuals, which facilitates collaboration and student output as they develop their story together. Furthermore, the game can be easily customized to match the vocabulary and content of any language unit. I will also present an analysis of collaborative learning strategies utilized by L1 English, L2 Spanish learners who played the RPG as part of their 3rd-semester Spanish language course. The analysis will provide examples of team problem-solving, peer support, and conflict resolution observed during the session. Finally, I will discuss how this tool could be modified or supplemented to target a wide variety of language skills.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to propose LARPnography as a more holistic method to probe the emergence of plausible futures, drawing on embodied embedded cognition literature and the emerging consumer practice of live-action role-playing (LARP). Current research methods for probing the future of markets and society rely mainly on expert judgment (i.e. Delphi), imagery or simulation of possible futures (i.e. scenario and simulation) and perspective taking (i.e. role-playing). The predominant focus on cognitive abstraction limits the insights researchers can extract from more embodied, sensorial and experiential approaches. LARPnography is a qualitative method seeking to immerse participants within a plausible future to better understand the social and market dynamics that may unfold therein. Through careful planning, design, casting and fieldwork, researchers create the preconditions to let participants experience what the future may be and gather critical insights from naturalistic observations and post-event interviews. Owing to its interactive nature and processual focus, LARPnography is best suited to investigate the adoption and diffusion of innovation, market emergence phenomena and radical societal changes, including the rise of alternative societies. Different from previous foresight methods, LARPnography creates immersive and perceptually stimulating replicas of plausible futures that research participants can inhabit. The creation of a fictional yet socio-material world ensures that socially constructed meaning is enriched by phenomenological and visceral insights.},

Responses on the SDQ indicated that participants had typical strengths and difficulties with respect to social competence at the time of the current study. The qualitative description indicated the emergence of four main themes related to role-playing games from the interviews: Content Focus, Social Focus, Creativity Focus, and Identity Focus. The themes present in the interviews are consistent with findings from previous case study research, suggesting that role-playing games may have the potential to improve perceived social competence, and further elucidate the lived experiences of people who play role-playing games in terms of why they engage with tabletop role-playing games.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 has already taken over millions of lives and has brought the entire world to a halt. It has been a great challenge for teachers and students alike, especially for children. The area of education has reimagined itself. Children began to actively learn through the screens of their computers, tablets, and some, even cellphones. This article brings an experience report about strategies involving the principals and themes of Role-Playing Games used for online classes of English aimed at Brazilian children around the ages of five to nine years old. Role-playing games (at times also spelled as roleplaying games; abbreviated to RPG or RPGs) are games in which the people participating in them (players) assume the roles of characters within a fictional setting. The idea of using RPG strategies to retain the attention of children while teaching from afar, via Zoom, Skype or any other platform that allows the direct interaction between educator and student comes from RPGs’ incredible capacity of transporting the mind of children to a different space, a space of attention and entertainment. As perceived by Tolomei (2017) and also shown in this experience report, motivation and engagement are enhanced through game mechanics. The technique also fulfills the need for human relationships, which has been taken away by COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Recent immersive theatre practices being developed by UK theatre companies invite children to believe that a book story has come to life and is really happening to them within their school environment. The thrill of being able act within a story motivates children’s embodied agency to physically explore an immersive set installation and acts of creative writing performed during the story experience, which allow children to co-create the narrative alongside the adult practitioners. These acts are fictionalised into the narrative frame of the children as heroic story writers, offering new perspectives on how child co-creation of adult narratives can be enabled intra-textually, within the bounds of the adult-initiated story, rather than extra-textually after it has finished, as is the case with fan fiction. However, it raises questions about the nature and limits of this co-creative agency the experiences purport to elicit from their child participants, especially in terms of their critical agency to manipulate fictional devices presented to them through such a hyper-real aesthetic. Drawing on theories of children’s literature and participatory performance, this article argues that it is the way these immersive productions uncannily overlay real and fictional temporalities that enables the child participants’ critical agency within them. Approaches for further participatory, practice-based research in this understudied corner of children’s reading universes are suggested for harnessing the potential of immersive story worlds to generate research data from within children’s first aesthetic engagement with stories.},

The cyborg is positioned as a theory by Donna J. Haraway to explore the expansive opportunities to surpass gender binaries by embracing technological adaptation to human forms. I push this concept further to determine how gender is perceived and performed in imagined sci-fi futures. My research focuses on the practice of embracing cyborgian technology through interactive play in role-playing games within the science fiction subgenre, cyberpunk. In examining the works, Cyberpunk Red (a table-top role-playing game) and Cyberpunk 2077 (a role-playing video game), I interrogate the potential for the cyborg to be queered through collaborative and interactive play. By delving into the history and structure of role-playing games along with the themes of the cyberpunk genre, I reflect on the queer potential that this media provides to players and audiences.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the practice of live action roleplay (larp) in terms of the distributions of power, agency and authority that inhere to it. It asks how experiences and stories are constituted in larping through collaborative participation, and what representations of Others’ experiences have to do with their grounds. It addresses these concerns by developing an autoethnographic methodology that utilises practical experiences of larping in analysing the political relationships that become between the player and both their co-players and those whose experiences they represent through their play. This analysis uses aspects of Whitehead’s philosophy of organism as a theoretical framework. The research therefore constitutes a practice-led theoretical study into the politics of playing together and of playing the lives of Others. The thesis argues for an interpretation of larping as a ‘methektic’ performance paradigm as well as a practice of ‘listening’ to the experiences of Others. Practically, the thesis investigates my experiences of playing in four international larps: La Sirena Varada, College of Wizardry, Inside Hamlet and Legion: Siberian Story. In each case study I look at a different aspect of participation and representation. Firstly, I look at how my experiences are constituted through my togetherness with other players; secondly, how dramaturgy and its playful counterpart, ludaturgy, affect experiences of roleplaying and story-making; thirdly, whether the representation of extreme experience as experience is possible; and finally, whether larped experience can foster empathy with historical others. Through these analyses, the thesis suggests that the most valuable insights larping offers come from participation in the practice rather than the representation of characters and actions, and that participation supersedes representation as a mode of engagement in this practice.},

Their positive effects on managing various clinical conditions stem from enhancing social skills. However, cost-effective options like Table-top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs), which offer similar benefits to other game-based interventions, lack standardized methods for ensuring replicability. In this regard, the method outlined in this study endeavors, in a structured and guided manner drawing from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to establish a six-step protocol for developing an intervention method utilizing TTRPGs. In all Steps, we aim to anchor ourselves in robust literature concerning social skills training (SST), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and gamification comprehensively. Thus, the method presented encompasses the objectives of SST, the strategies of CBT, and the dynamics of gamification via TTRPGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate a possible application of the method to illustrate its feasibility. Ultimately, the final method is structured, evidence-based, easily applicable, cost-effective, and thus viable. Mental health professionals seeking a structured and instructional tool for protocol development will find support in the method proposed here.},

  abstract = {Tabletop roleplaying games are a form of in-person, multiplayer games structured around group interaction, set rules of gameplay, strategic group decision-making, and active character roleplaying. While such games have existed in some form for thousands of years, more recent and modern versions such as Dungeons \& Dragons and Call of Cthulhu have increased attention not only to their use as a form of entertainment, but as a potential extension of play and drama therapies in a clinical setting (Henrich \& Worthington, 2021). Research into therapeutic roleplaying, both with and without gameplay supervision, has shown a promising association with increased understanding of self-concept and connection to community (House, 1970; Winn, 1959) as well as a reduction in depression and anxiety (Burroughs, Wagner \& Johnson, 1997; Wilde, 1994). However, historical investigations have primarily concentrated on younger age groups, where play and drama therapies are most frequently employed with a focus on individual development and social connections. Recent studies have only just begun to investigate tabletop roleplaying games as a form of therapy; most have involved case-studies that apply theoretical and anecdotal, rather than clinical, evidence of the game’s effective use as a mechanism of therapeutic treatment (Blackmon, 1994; Hughes, 1988). The current study aimed to extend tabletop roleplaying games research to a larger, more varied age group (N = 184, Average age = 19.2) through an online survey. We assessed participants’ experience with the game and reasons to participate in gameplay, and examined any correlations between levels of depression, anxiety, and amount of participation in tabletop roleplaying games. Results indicated that participants generally felt that tabletop roleplaying games supported their mental health and well-being, particularly in the context of roleplaying in their character’s mindset. We also found that frequency of play was negatively associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, even when controlling for predictors on the Ten Item Personality Measure such as conscientiousness and emotional stability (Gosling et al., 2003). This may suggest that individuals experiencing depression or social anxiety turn to tabletop roleplaying games as a method to respond and cope with these symptoms. The implications of these results, as well as directions for further research in this burgeoning field are discussed.},

At the same time, nostalgia has emerged as a central component of geek culture. Framed by a post-structural understanding of gender and race and drawing on cultural theorist Svetlana Boym’s distinction between reflective and restorative nostalgia, this article explores how and why geeks nostalgically long for a time when they were largely marginalized. We combine readings of Swedish online geek podcasts and YouTube channels with ethnographic visits to geek conferences and pop-cultural “geek fairs,” such as Comic Con and SciFiWorld. We argue that geek nostalgia represents a clinging on to a “constitutive wound,” allowing the geek figure to mobilize masculine victimhood in ways that simultaneously underpin geek privilege and allow the geek to continue operating as a white male gatekeeper of geek culture.},

Some of these performance concepts are how LARP can be considered “improv in disguise,” how the use of rules systems both helps and hinders ideas of agency and immersion, and how issues of consent are essential to the success of creating a shared reality among diverse personalities. The article begins with an auto-ethnographic description of the LARP event Broken Covenant, which leads to explaining how LARGE began and how it differs from more well-known boffer LARPS. The article then drills down on the varied histories of the interview subjects and explores the concept of improvisation in LARP as ‘yes, but…,’ in comparison to the well-known improv mantra of ‘yes, and. …’ Agency and immersion are explored, leading to a discussion of emotional investment and, most important, consent. The article demonstrates that there is a vibrant and sophisticated LARP community in Edmonton (mostly transplanted from Saskatoon) creating performances in the non-traditional milieu of LARP.},

Many shows and podcasts feature popular TTRPG Dungeons and Dragons, among various additional games. These games have the powerful potential to examine identity, identity formation, and many personal issues through roleplaying potential. Collective storytelling and character development are cornerstones of this process. With this potential, it is important to realize the potential for negative experiences and tabletop spaces that could potentially cause more harm than good for players. This article examines the connections between TTRPGs and the intimacy process. Mainly exploring how intimacy tools such as the “button,” boundary practice, and consent-based world-building can significantly impact the game experience. As a result, I discuss how these processes additionally benefit the individual player. Ultimately, I argue that TTRPGs are strengthened through engagement with the intimacy process.},

  abstract = {Because the COVID-19 pandemic essentially restructured the way we live our lives, many of us now do far more of our work, hobbies, and socializing online rather than in-person. What this changed environment means in terms of satisfying our social needs is not fully understood. To explore this question, I followed a group of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game players as they navigated adjusting their formerly in-person weekly game sessions to a virtual environment. While using a virtual tabletop platform for visual collaboration and a voice chat program to speak with one another allowed the players to hold sessions and didn’t appear to restrict their creative engagement with the game, the restrictions of the virtual environment inhibited social interaction and in one case worsened social anxiety for the players. This suggests that if we want to sustain online collaborative work in the future, we may need to reevaluate our virtual communication methods to better facilitate group-strengthening interactions.},

The live-action role-play (larp) community is no exception to this and looks at an increasing number of international networks and collaborations. But the social, cultural and structural circumstances in which regional larp associations operate differ between nations. in international conversations often revolve around the question of cultural differences in larp-styles and inspirations for own projects, organisational inquiries on how to start and keep larp events running. This paper aims to show best practice examples of educational larp (edularp) in child and youth work, carried out by the exemplarily selected German non-formal, educational organisation Waldritter e.V., and how this organisation formed, operates and has been financing its projects securely since the mid-2000s.},

  abstract = {This dissertation looks to study the potential impacts and influences of media use and consumption on how individuals play Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D), a popular tabletop role-playing game. Now enjoying its 7th consecutive year of record profits, D\&D has grown alongside a wave of D\&D media, with the traditional board game taking on new digital forms that alter how players can now interact with the hobby. Utilizing media theories such as figurations, Medium Theory, the Magic Circle, and the concept of media worlds, this paper l:ooks at both the media objects being consumed and what influences they left with their user. Interpretive focus groups were used to collect testimony from groups that played D\&D together, examining individual impacts and how groups as a whole negotiated their media use while playing. When looking at media consumed, it appears that the most common Uses by participants included Entertainment, gathering Information, or finding Tools to use during gameplay. Overall, Tool media were the most frequently utilized, although the physical distancing required by COVID-19 was cited as a factor in this widespread use. Demonstrated by the Engagement-Consumption-Impacts model, the major influences discovered were increases in the user's Game Knowledge and a decrease in the level of Rules-Adhesion, or how strictly the written rules of the game were enforced. Other findings included participants changing the style in which they played D\&D, basing changes off the habits of players they watched online or strategies found to become "better" players. This study also suggests further implications of the theories used. In particular, the study of the "alpha media object," media capable of impacting the user, the other media objects surrounding it, and even the figuration model as a whole, leaves several questions for future scholars to examine. In this study, that alpha media object was the podcast Critical Role (2015), a show so popular that it has begun to impact not just players, but the game of Dungeons \& Dragons itself; the larger implications of the alpha media object, however, can be extended to the study of any media ecosystem or user.},

Research questions sought to identify which experiences were meaningful, beneficial, and appealing about the game. Through purposive non-random sampling, a total of 60 respondents answered the survey between June and August 2016. Majority of respondents were male, within the age range of 25 - 34 years, and having at least 1 - 3 years of experience. Thematic analysis was used to categorize the data acquired through an online survey. The researcher categorized keywords into three core elements: Creative, Emotional, and Social Experiences. The findings show that there is no doubt role-playing games such as D\&D have the potential to entertain, heal, and educate. Psychological implications include D\&D and TRPGs alike to be used in both therapeutic and educational settings. When designed thoughtfully and facilitated carefully, RPGs can help clients understand themselves on a deeper level, or discover something new about them. Even for regular players, RPGs can be a playground to exercise social and cognitive skills.},

  abstract = {This essay explores the application in live participatory performance of “participant engagement,” an ethnographic method of participant observation originally developed to study online roleplaying communities, but which has also been applied to the study of theatrical, coperformative events in which the audience has meaningful agency. The challenge here is how to frame “audience ethnography” in contexts where the relationship between audience and performer is blurred. This can involve a range of dynamics, whether the performer and audience are one and the same, such as in online or live action roleplaying, or in cases where audience agency has an active role in composing the work. Many of these forms do not allow for passive participation, requiring researchers to actively engage in the coperformance. Through the lenses of performance and feminist ethnography, participant engagement frames the embodied researcher as performer and the act of participant observation as a performance to address three paradoxes inherent in studying immersive fictional worlds: (1) the need to adopt a fictional persona compatible with the world being studied; (2) the need to fully engage with the play activities proscribed by the fictional context; (3) the need to reconcile the inherent contradiction within factual ethnographic accounts of a fictional worlds.},

Afin d'étudier le phénomène de l'étiquetage social, nous avons décidé d'étudier une sous-culture dépréciée: la sous-culture des rôlistes. En effet, nos recherches préliminaires nous ont amenée à constater que cette communauté est décriée de manière très virulente. Cependant, nous nous sommes posés la question à savoir pourquoi une telle opinion? Pourquoi ce passe-temps est-il dénigré? Ces jeunes sont-ils dangereux ou fous? Les jeux sont-ils vecteurs de pathologies? Pourquoi une telle mise à l'écart? Notre but, dans cette étude, est d'identifier la stigmatisation et l'étiquetage dont ils sont victime et d'en comprendre les mécanismes. Nous voulons savoir si les joueurs sont des jeunes comme les autres ou en dehors de la réalité, une sorte de jeunesse dégénérée en mal de socialisation. La mise en marge de cette sous-culture par la société est un phénomène complexe que nous analysons dans cette recherche. Afin de mieux comprendre ce que sont les jeux de rôle, nous effectuons un bref historique des courants littéraires qui ont façonné le jeu de rôle jusqu'à aujourd'hui dont, principalement, le courant de la Fantasy, puis nous expliquons ce qu'est ce jeu de rôle. Pour mener à bien notre recherche, nous nous appuyons sur une méthodologie qualitative. Nous effectuons, une observation participante auprès d'un groupe de joueurs parisiens afin de comprendre leur dynamique et celle des jeux. N'ayant jamais joué aux jeux, nous confrontons notre point de vue avant l'expérience et après, afin de saisir si les jeux sont effectivement répréhensibles. Puis, nous interrogeons des non-joueurs pour connaître leur opinion sur les jeux. Des entrevues avec les joueurs nous permettent enfin de confronter les opinions et de comprendre quelle est leur position vis à vis des accusations à leur encontre. Le cadre théorique de l'École de Chicago et de l'interactionnisme symbolique nous permet de développer les concepts de l'étiquetage et de la stigmatisation, notions sur lesquelles nous nous basons pour effectuer notre analyse. Nos principaux résultats sont que les joueurs, considérés comme « déracinés », sont des jeunes comme les autres, passionnés par un passe-temps surtout inconnu. L'opinion générale serait propagée par les médias, entraînant une panique morale. Nous observons ainsi deux attitudes des joueurs face à ceci: devenir une source d'information; ou bien, développer une stigmatisation auprès de leurs accusateurs. La stigmatisation et l'étiquetage sont donc les résultats d'une influence extérieure impalpable. Il nous est apparu que le stigmate apportant le stigmate, le cercle apparaît difficile à briser.},

  abstract = {Mentioning: 13 -  Abstract. The Interactive Dilemma is the inevitable conflict between author's determinism and interactor's freedom. There are some approaches that try to tackle it, using strategies and heuristic rules that can combine on the fly the previously designed author material with the run-time decisions of the interactor. Interactive Narrative is a relatively new field and it is difficult to find formal studies that shows how to create this kind of art. Our proposal is based on the theoretical study of tabletop Role-Playing Games and it involves the practical implementation of those ideas for managing the interaction in a simple text adventure game. Game Masters are the best models we have found in real life for designing and directing interactive stories. In this paper we transfer their player modeling, their rules for interaction management and their improvising algorithms from the real world to a new Interactive Storytelling system.},

  abstract = {Manual data annotation is an important NLP task but one that takes a considerable amount of resources and effort. In spite of the costs, labelling and categorizing entities are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic evaluation. Even though annotation can be done by non-experts in most cases, due to the fact that this requires human labour, the process is costly. Another major challenge encountered in data annotation is maintaining annotation consistency. Annotation efforts are typically carried out by teams of multiple annotators. The annotations need to maintain consistency in relation to both the domain truth and annotation format while reducing human errors. Annotating a specialized domain that deviates significantly from the general domain, such as fantasy literature, will see a significant amount of human error and annotator disagreement. So it is vital that proper guidelines and error reduction mechanisms are enforced. One way to enforce these constraints is by using a specialized application. Such an app can ensure that the notations are consistent, and the labels can be pre-defined or restricted reducing the room for errors. In this paper, we present SHADE, an annotation software that can be used to annotate entities in the high fantasy literature domain Dungeons and Dragons extracted from the Forgotten Realms Fandom Wiki.},

  abstract = {Considering the rapid growth of TRPGs (Tabletop role playing games) in the digital age, and that most previous TRPG studies have focused on offline TRPGs, there is a need to engage further studies on online TRPGs. Most of existing previous studies on similar topics have focused on Europe and the United States, and have rarely covered Asian, Africa and Latin American geographic regions. In this context, I conducted a study on Chinese TRPGs in the digital age. This thesis adopted a qualitative research methodology, specifically including participant observation, case study analysis and thick description.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}The thesis found that in the digital age, the communication and gaming approach between{$<$}br/{$>$}common players and Game Masters (GMs) in China have undergone significant changes. The{$<$}br/{$>$}popularization of online TRPGs has revolutionized the gaming experience. Online meeting{$<$}br/{$>$}software, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, have eliminated technical barriers and made online TRPGs more accessible. The advantages of online TRPGs include overcoming spatial distance, enhancing game props, and enabling more convenient use of multiple medium forms. With emergence of online TRPGs in China, it is necessary to rethink of small group communication. As for communicative activities in small groups, four aspects related to TRPG play were examined: the roles performed within the group, the impact of digital gathering on speech and discussion, strategies for overcoming team disagreements, and the distribution of in-game resources. The use of technology in TRPGs during the digital age has had a significant impact on TRPG play in China. Compared with conventional offline TRPGs, online TRPGs offer advantages in terms of accessibility and the establishment of online communities, they also encounter new challenges. The development of TRPG technology has contributed to improved digital character cards, advanced map-making software, and the ability to create professional replay productions. TRPG rules and players' attitudes towards them have undergone notable changes in the digital age in China. With the expansion of internet culture, a multitude of TRPG rules now exist. Most of these TRPG rules are created by players seeking customization and flexibility. The high learning costs associated with many traditional rules have led to the development of new rule sets. Additionally, players often draw inspiration from their favorite literary or film productions to create unique rulesets.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}It is anticipated that these research findings will fill the gap in game research on Chinese TRPGs and digital TRPGs, and provide valuable reference for the industry practise to better develop digital TRPG rules and modules.},

D\&D participants (n = 18) attended five one-hour weekly D\&D sessions, meanwhile the comparison group (n = 10) went through their first semester of college with no intervention, but completed the study measures at the same points in time as the D\&D participants. All participants completed measures of social connection, adjustment to college, college stress, and self-esteem within the first two months of their first semester of college and again approximately six weeks later (after the D\&D group met for five weeks). Participants in the D\&D group demonstrated a significantly greater change in college stress than the comparison group, specifically a reduction in stress. Furthermore, the D\&D group also demonstrated significantly greater personal-emotional adjustment to college (subscale of the student adaptation to college questionnaire). Given the substantial amount of anecdotal evidence on the benefits of D\&D, it is integral to continue to examine evidential support for a game with increasing recreational popularity and potential therapeutic/interventional benefits.},

No Brasil por meio de um movimento que busca melhorar a imagem do hobby após supostos envolvimentos em crimes, o jogo ganhou espaço nas salas de aulas como instrumento metodológico de ensino, inclusive no ensino de História. A presente dissertação surgiu da preocupação em torno do jogo assumir caráter de recurso didático no ensino de História, tendo como fonte principal o RPG escrito por Luiz Eduardo Ricon, O Descobrimento do Brasil, lançado durante as comemorações dos 500 anos do Brasil. Através de uma análise das referencias utilizadas pelo autor, nossa proposta se insere na tentativa de caracterizar o tipo de Cultura Histórica que tal produto da indústria cultural constrói a partir do momento que propõe uma narrativa acerca dos Descobrimentos e da História do Brasil, trazendo representações que giram em torno da própria ideia de Identidade Nacional.},

  abstract = {Often dismissed as "not serious," the notion of play has nevertheless been at the centre of classical theories of religion and ritual (Huizinga, Caillois, Turner, Staal, etc.). What can be retained of those theories for the contemporary study of religions? Can a study of "play" or "game" bring new perspectives for the study of religions? The book deals with the history of games and their relation to religions, the links between divination and games, the relations between sport and ritual, the pedagogical functions of games in religious education, and the interaction between games, media and religions. Richly illustrated, the book contributes to the study of religions, to ritual, game and media studies, and addresses an academic as well as a general public. Philippe Bornet, Dr. Phil., born in 1977, is Lecturer in the Study of Religion at the Faculty of Lettres of the University of Lausanne, with focus on the history of interrelations between India and Europe. Maya Burger is Professor of Indian Studies and History of Religions at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Lausanne, Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations.},

  abstract = {To recap, in 1969, Arneson's Napoleonic Simulation Campaign had incorporated a postal Diplomacy game as a "background" strategic context for its tactical miniature battles, specifically the "Napoleonic Diplomacy II" variant by Gary Gygax. The Twin Cities gamers expanded the variant to include additional nations—ultimately comprising dozens of players participating in a variety of governmental capacities—more detailed management of national economic resources, and a healthy dose of Arneson's favorite: maritime action.1 When forces conflicted in the Diplomacy game, rather than resolving the disagreement of those colored blocks as the Diplomacy rules recommended, the contests were translated into miniature tabletop battles fought by the participating wargamers. While others had implemented such two-mode "strategy-tactical" wargames before, few dared to attempt them with so many geographically dispersed participants. This made the resolution of moves dependent upon the results and reporting of many miniature wargames conducted in remote locations, and turns could thus drag on for months. Over the course of nearly four real-world years of play, the game progressed through only six Diplomacy turns (which, in the variant in question, alternate between spring and fall), progressing in game time from the beginning of 1800 up to the end of 1802. Advancement at the strategic level held less importance for the participants than the tactical miniature battles. Naval combat followed the emerging Don't Give Up the Ship rules, but for warfare on land, the Twin Cities gamers invoked a different set of Napoleonic rules designed by local gamer Dave Wesely.},

Over the intervening weeks, Gygax reported, "being sickly and not up to much, I drew up a couple levels of the local 'Blackmoor,' i.e. 'Greyhawk.'"1 In his first burst of creativity had drawn up twelve levels, and "some of my levels cover two sheets of paper." In the Great Kingdom, he reported the location of Greyhawk "will be that to the south, by the water, just below the Grand Duchy of Ernst (Urnst?) south of Nyr Div." This area was also then known as the "Wild Lands," though the land above it was wilder still, as Urnst was a prehistoric setting in the Great Kingdom, overrun with dinosaurs. To its west was Keoland—a place named for Gygax's deceased childhood friend Tom Keough—where there were beasts from Barsoom, the Martian setting of Edgar Rice Burroughs's novels, including thoats, banths, and apts. As Gygax began to develop rules, he drew on these sorts of exotic creatures for inspiration. But his focus was on the dungeon—already he could report that "the chaps were so nuts about the game that most of my spare time has flown into levels and rules for an eventual campaign similar to yours. We have 11 players at this moment!"},

That summer, for Panzerfaust (59), Don Lowry had invited various luminaries of the wargaming community to prognosticate on the future of the industry. Most of the responses agonized over the glut of commercial wargames in the marketplace, as if the respondents informally conspired to discourage any additional competition by overstating the market's saturation. A few months later in the General, Thomas Shaw of Avalon Hill gave a candid perspective on the state of the industry: "The wargame today is still much the same as it was in 1952," when Charles S. Roberts conceived the original Tactics (AHG 10 (3)). Despite having reviewed the work of, "at conservative estimate, at least 10,000 freelance designers," Shaw attested that "in the wargame field, there really hasn't been anything dramatically new since Gettysburg," a 1958 title. The form letter that Avalon Hill dispatched to prospective designers suggested they submit only games "unlike any other on the market." So where were those games? "It is my opinion that we have today far too many games on the market that are re-hashes of old formulas… Frankly, I've seen nothing startlingly new in over a decade." Shaw intuited the market's receptiveness to something "startlingly new," yet could not quite divine what might fill that void. None of the respondents to Lowry's survey mentioned fantasy wargaming, not even Lowry himself.},

While advertisements could create brand awareness, an article by Gygax could deliver far more impact by illustrating the play of the game or its relationship to broader traditions in fantasy literature and wargaming.

Crane, a Chicago-area wargamer, had ranked as a High Constable in the now-defunct Castle \& Crusade Society.1 As Gygax's foreword to Tricolor (dated April 1, 1974) indicates, Crane also played Napoleonics against Perren, which positioned him nicely to approach Gygax for publication; Tricolor had originally appeared on the future product list for Guidon Games in 1973.2 While we need not detail the relatively dense system of Tricolor, its very existence confirms that TSR did not intended to retire on Dungeons \& Dragons, but would continue to produce unrelated products in other wargame settings.},

To GenCon VII belongs this: it introduced Dungeons \& Dragons to the wargaming community. Gamers from around the country brought home rules, or at least news, of this novel game, and numerous wargaming clubs thereafter became increasingly—if not unhealthily—preoccupied with dungeon adventures. Fortunately, we have several detailed accounts of the goings-on at GenCon VII, including those of former IFW President Bill Hoyer in the American Wargamer and in Signal, and that of James Lur- vey in GPGPN (12), all published in September 1974.},

TSR managed gross sales of around twelve thousand dollars in its first year of existence, an amount sufficient to forestall bankruptcy, but hardly an omen of blockbuster sales to come.1 In mid-January 1975, Gygax dispatched to the fanzine Europa a description of the bustling everyday operation of the TSR partnership one year into its life: TSR is run from the home of Mr. Kaye at present, although we expect this to change within a year or two. (Remember that our firm is only two years old NEXT November). Orders come to that address at an average of perhaps ten per day—although that total includes orders from stores and distributors, so it gives no real picture of what volume we move. Mr. Kaye handles from 50-75 orders per week. Between one and two letters per day are sent to TSR inquiring about one thing or another.

Blume and Gygax used TSR Hobbies, Inc. as an umbrella company to purchase the assets of the original TSR partnership on September 26, 1975, effectively buying out Donna Kaye.1 From that point on, no longer were new TSR games emblazoned with the Gygax-Kaye "GK" logo, but instead with the lizard man of TSR Hobbies.2 In November 1975, consumer demand for Dungeons \& Dragons justified a fourth printing of five thousand more copies; between January and November 1975, D\&D shipped nearly three times as many boxed sets as it had during the same span the previous year. This latest printing abandoned the woodgrain box of prior editions in favor of a shrink-wrapped white box, and though it appeared in greater numbers, D\&D sales still represented only a tiny fraction of the wargaming market. Sales do not necessarily reflect popularity, however, and this small Lake Geneva company grew at pace with its rising stature.},

  abstract = {When Gygax leveraged the Strategic Review as a platform to criticize alleged distortions of Dungeons \& Dragons, he provoked increasing scrutiny not only of his own style of gaming, but also of the very basis of TSR's fundamental authority over D\&D. As Swanson's review of the Origins I tournament suggested, many believed Gygax's tastes as a dungeon master tended toward impersonal deathtraps, and this perception, right or wrong, discredited Gygax in the eyes of many readers of A\&E and other fanzines. Among the young audience for D\&D, a natural antiauthoritarian streak triggered a knee-jerk reaction to any pronouncements from on high. For example, in the March Wargamer's Information (14), (also reprinted in Fire the Arquebusiers! 2-3) there appeared an article by Bill Maxwell, Jr. called "A Creative Look at D\&D/EPT (or) Gary Gygax is not a god!" which advised readers: Remember that YOU ARE THE MODERATOR, not E. Gary Gygax. Don't feel urged on or inhibited by his many creatures and rules. If you don't like his combat system (I hate it and I don't use it) don't use it! If you think EPT is too much like D\&D in its mechanics, CHANGE THEM…. If you think the rules for Assassins and Monks are worthless (which they are) by all means change 'em or skip 'em. Gary Gygax may be a good moderator as far as moderators go, but he isn't a good fantasy game designer. (WI (14))},

A growing community of fans adored Dungeons \& Dragons, wanting both to contribute to the game and to take its innovations in new directions— not necessarily with TSR's blessing. And then there was TSR itself, a fledgling company that had sold around four thousand copies of D\&D by the beginning of 1976, and in the twelve months that followed, would sell around twice that number. Over the course of that year, TSR slowly pivoted to embrace the term "role-playing game" for its marquee products—a decision made necessary by the whim of the community at large, which had located D\&D within that genre—but also motivated by how poorly verbiage like "fantastic medieval wargames campaigns" would apply to the releases in its pipeline.},

To find wargames involving miniatures, small (typically metal) figurines resembling and representing soldiers and their vehicles, artillery, or equipment, we must look outside the scope of the Avalon Hill General. Alluding to the focus of Don Featherstone's competing magazine, Wargamer's Newsletter, the General asserted, with some wariness, that it described "the use of realistic models of terrain features and soldiers themselves" (AHG 1 (6)). To liberate terrain from the flatland of board wargames, proponents staged "sand box battles" on special tables, where they sculpted and decorated wet sand into precise three-dimensional landscapes for their battles.1 This was clearly a very different thing than an Avalon Hill product.},

Bodenstedt assigned no specific date or place to the game, and most likely, as Wagner observed above, the scenario of The Siege of Bodenburg owes more to the miniatures stocked by Continental Hobby Supplies than any inspirational historical incident.},

Even with that admirable sales channel, Avalon Hill outsold SPI by around ten to one in 1970, and closer to fifty to one in 1969—that follows SPI's own figures, which might charitably be deemed somewhat biased (S\&T 33). All of the other minor publishers of board wargames combined constituted no more than one or two percent of the market. Even the top-shelf works of SPI's star designer, James F. Dunnigan, only became darlings of the market under Avalon Hill's imprint: a notable example would be the influential AH game Panzerblitz (1970), a Dunnigan project, which S\&T initially distributed as a prototype.},

At the beginning of 1972, the newsletter reached the peak of its production quality and circulation. As a sounding board for some of the most important designs and designers of the preceding four years, the International Wargamer appeared to be an institution resting on a secure foundation. That illusion would be dashed in the spring of 1972, though the woes of the IFW extended back several months. The previous November, Lenard Lakofka, IFW President, had announced the resignation of both the Vice-President and Treasurer of the IFW, which meant that the responsibilities of both these offices reverted to the President.1 New elections were called for the IFW Senate over the Christmas holidays (Dave Arneson stood for a seat), but the returning instructions were unnecessarily complex, and as Don Lowry would remark as late as January 1973, "the results of election of officers held about a year ago have yet to be announced to the membership," leaving the work of the Senate in Lakofka's hands as well (PZF (57)).},

  abstract = {The story of the arcane table-top game that became a pop culture phenomenon and the long-running legal battle waged by its cocreators. When Dungeons \& Dragons was first released to a small hobby community, it hardly seemed destined for mainstream success—and yet this arcane tabletop role-playing game became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon. In Game Wizards, Jon Peterson chronicles the rise of Dungeons \& Dragons from hobbyist pastime to mass-market sensation, from the initial collaboration to the later feud of its creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. As the game's fiftieth anniversary approaches, Peterson—a noted authority on role-playing games—explains how D\&D and its creators navigated their successes, setbacks, and controversies. Peterson describes Gygax and Arneson's first meeting and their work toward the 1974 release of the game; the founding of TSR and its growth as a company; and Arneson's acrimonious departure and subsequent challenges to TSR. He recounts the “Satanic Panic” accusations that D\&D was sacrilegious and dangerous, and how they made the game famous. And he chronicles TSR's reckless expansion and near-fatal corporate infighting, which culminated with the company in debt and overextended and the end of Gygax's losing battle to retain control over TSR and D\&D. With Game Wizards, Peterson restores historical particulars long obscured by competing narratives spun by the one-time partners. That record amply demonstrates how the turbulent experience of creating something as momentous as Dungeons \& Dragons can make people remember things a bit differently from the way they actually happened.},

The invention of role-playing games serves as a touchstone for exploring the ways that the literary concept of character, the lure of fantastic adventure and the principles of gaming combined into the signature cultural innovation of the late twentieth century.},

  abstract = {The first volume of two in a new, updated edition of the 2012 book Playing at the World, which charts the vast and complex history of role-playing games. This new edition of Playing at the World is the first of two volumes that update the 720-page original tome of the same name from 2012. This first volume is The Invention of Dungeons \& Dragons, which explores the publication of that iconic game. (The second volume is The Three Pillars of Role-Playing Games, a deeper dive into the history of the setting, system, and character of D \& D.) In this first volume, Jon Peterson distills the story of how the wargaming clubs and fanzines circulating around the upper Midwest in the 1970s culminated in Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson's seminal role-playing game, D \& D. It augments the research of the original editions with new insights into the crucial period in 1972–3 when D \& D began to take shape. Drawing from primary sources ranging from eighteenth-century strategists to modern hobbyists, Playing at the World explores the origins of wargames and roleplaying through the history of conflict simulations and the eccentric characters who drove the creation of a signature cultural innovation in the late twentieth century. Filled with unparalleled archival research (from obscure fanzines to letters, drafts, and other ephemera), this new edition of Playing at the World is the ultimate geek's guide to the original RPG. As such, it is an indispensable resource for academics and game fans exploring the origins of the hobby.},

Dungeons \& Dragons most directly emerged from the intersection of two key precursors: a wargaming tradition of conflict simulation games and a genre of immersive fantastic literature. But long before Dungeons \& Dragons, the core participants in Coventry became innovators in the development of collaborative stories, both in writing and through improvisational performance. Dungeons \& Dragons instantiated these diverse elements in a way that was nothing short of transformative. Role-playing games created a novel and extraordinary connection between players and characters that made fans see both parallel and prior activities in a new light. The creative forces unleashed by the wargaming community invented crucial components of role-playing games. Some wargames put players in the position of assuming the role of an individual character rather than administering a military force.},

It aimed to show the cultural and conceptual roots of the game design principles that D\&D popularized: everything from dungeons and dragons to experience points and levels, hit points and armor class, referees (dungeon masters) and players, monsters and treasure, dice and maps. A bit of poking around convinced me that there was an untold story there, and I could see a path to telling it.},

How do games change when they move from one cultural or historical context to another?

TTRPG are great for immersing players in the game world with proven potential for transformative learning, as they promote perspective taking and a deeper understanding of the storyworld. In this work we aim to explore TTRPGs as an activity supporting the education of history in secondary education, by recording the view of educators on the benefits and challenges of the game. History teachers play a key role in teaching students how to examine historical phenomena and recognize the importance of history in understanding the societies of today. We interviewed 7 educators to explore how they promote historical empathy in their lessons and their views on the potential of TTRPGs as educational tools. Our results indicate a positive outlook by educators regarding the implementation of TTRPGs in the classroom, also discussing challenges such as the use of violence, historical inaccuracy and anachronism. The findings are hopeful in terms of the potential acceptance of the game genre by the teachers and they can be used as the initial step towards guidelines for a TTRPG game design tailored to the needs of secondary education.},

En effet, ce mouvement d’abord américain a fait une entrée remarquée dans l’espace public qui incite à s’interroger sur sa réalité sociologique. Les geeks sont abordés ici comme fans de mondes imaginaires fantastiques (science-fiction, fantasy…), passionnés de nouvelles technologies et en tant que public premier et fondateur du processus de convergence culturelle théorisé par Henry Jenkins. La montée en visibilité du phénomène geek est ainsi liée dans cette étude à celle de pratiques médiatiques associées à ce processus (fanfictions, démocratisation des outils numériques, œuvres transmédiatiques et immersives, etc.). Dans ce cadre, le tournant réflexif (vers un sentiment d’appartenance à une identité collective) et la mode médiatique autour de la culture geek ces dernières années trouvent leurs racines dans les moments fondateurs de la convergence culturelle (depuis les pulps fictions et la naissance des comic books jusqu’à la sortie de Star Wars, du Seigneur des anneaux, des premiers jeux de rôles et jeux vidéo). Mais cela doit aussi à la radicalisation récente des croisements médiatiques, des pratiques participatives, de la mondialisation des partages liée aux technologies numériques et au passage des identités prescrites aux identités choisies dans les sociétés contemporaines marquées par l’individualisme.},

  abstract = {For over three decades, there has been much controversy surrounding the use of fantasy role-playing games. The media and other groups have linked the use of fantasy role-playing games to violence, suicide, murder, Satanic practices, and other detrimental outcomes. Video game fantasy role-playing games have also been blamed for causing players to become depressed, isolated and suicidal. Empirical research on the effects of fantasy role-playing games on players is inconclusive. Heavy use of these games has been linked to negative outcomes. There is little information regarding whether the negative outcomes found in some studies are based on the format of the game (pencil-and-paper versus video game) versus the content of these games. This study investigated whether there is a difference among self-reported feelings of loneliness and depressive symptomatology among young adult players of fantasy role-playing games based on their level of use (heavy versus light) and format preference. A 2 x 2 factorial design was employed to compare groups of players on measures of loneliness and depressive symptomatology. Based on a review of the research, it was hypothesized that players who report heavy use of the video game format would produce significantly higher scores on depression and loneliness measures than other groups. The results indicate that those participants expressing a preference for the video game format showed significantly higher scores on the depression measure than those who expressed a preference for the pencil-and-paper format, suggesting that depressive symptoms are more common among those who prefer video game to pencil-and-paper fantasy role-playing games. Those participants reporting heavy use of either format produced significantly higher scores on both the depression and loneliness measures than those reporting light use. The results of this study suggest that there could be some detrimental impact of excessive use of fantasy role-playing games on players' social relationships and mood but it is also possible that those who are depressed and isolated tend to engage in excessive game-playing. Some implications for treating isolated and depressed young adults who use games excessively are discussed.},

The essay begins with an overview of role-playing practices in the context of what might be termed the “participatory turn” in performance and culture, providing examples tabletop and live action role-playing games. Goffman’s concept of “engrossment” (from his writings on games) is compared to Csikszentmihalyi’s notion of “flow” as applied to role-playing and emergent authorship. The relationship of character to role-play is also explored through Schechners “not me, not not me” paradox, in which a character is seen as a hybrid between the performer and the fictional entity. Finally, drawing on Goffman and Fine, I outline a series of sociological “frames” that describe the functions within role-playing, and conclude with further discussion of role-playing as it fits into the larger participatory turn in performance and culture.},

  abstract = {In this research pedagogical live action role playing is examined as a method of teaching history. The objective of this research is to present and define the concept of pedagogical live action role playing as a method of teaching history and examine its capability in teaching historical empathy. Pedagogical live action role playing is a teaching method under development which has elements from drama pedagogics and different learning theories. The theoretical part of this research consists of play theories and drama pedagogical theories which are relevant to live action role playing, and also the concepts of historical empathy and historical thinking. In drama pedagogics the main sources are the researches of Laakso (2004) and Heikkinen (2002, 2004). The historical part uses the researches of VanSledright (2002), Cooper (2000) and Ashby and Lee (1987) as its main sources.  The research was carried out at the Viikki Teacher Training School in the class 6b during autumn 2007. The research material consists of three-phased interviews. During all phases three pupils were interviewed, and during two of the phases, also the teacher of the class was interviewed. The methods used in the interviews were thematic interview and stimulated recall -interview. The data gathered from the interviews was analyzed using content analysis.  Pedagogical live action role playing has three phases when teaching history: pre-game (preparations), game (live action role play) and post-game (discussion after the game and in the classroom). The teacher's attention and carefulness is important during all phases. The mistakes made in the pre-game face e.g. in writing the characters seem to cause major problems in the pupils' game experiences.  Pedagogical live action role playing is capable of teaching historical empathy, but according to my research this has some conditions, from which the most important is the pupil's historical knowledge before the game. Teaching historical empathy was based on esthetic dualition: the pupil made decions about the actions of his character as him/herself. The more background information the pupil had about the era they played, the more the pupil seemed to make decisions based on his historical empathy, aka his understanding of the era of the larp and of the people of the same era.},

We seek to address that disconnection by studying relative levels of fulfillment and frequency of tabletop and online role-playing for World of Warcraft (WoW) subscribers. Finally, demographic information taken from the players themselves aids in guiding future research about which type of role-play gamers are more likely to participate in and find fulfilling. By looking at the age, location, and gender of players the relative merits of each type of role-playing is discussed, pointing to strategies to capitalize on the strengths and minimize the failings of each venue for role-playing. This study aids both the online and offline gaming industry in better understanding their target role-playing audiences, while providing a grounded study of avid role-players to support.},

  abstract = {Civil War reenactors claim to be educational through the nature of their bringing the past to life. Their claims place them among heritage and cultural interpreters in how they connect the past with the audience before them. However, the practice of Civil War reenacting has come under scrutiny in recent years for propagating a narrow view of history informed predominantly by nostalgic ideas of a Confederate lost-cause narrative. Through personal experience as a reenactor and living history interpreter, together with in-depth research of these practices, I propose that Civil War reenacting may at times include interpretive practices, however, its primary function as a hobbyist’s pastime places it in the realm of Live Action Roleplaying (LARPing) rather than heritage interpretation. From this, Civil War reenactments are largely based on the relationship between historically inspired personas and the actors’ own personalities rather than creating an interpretive experience for the public audience. It is the confusion between these two tendencies that has resulted in the fields of American Civil War reenactments becoming breeding grounds where ideologically narrow views of history and national identity may be perpetuated.},

  abstract = {Table-Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPG) such as Dungeons and Dragons (D\&amp;D, Gygax, 1978) are increasingly being used in therapeutic and educational contexts (Blackmon, 1994; Kato, 2019; Kwan, 2017; Zayas \&amp; Lewis, 1986), because of the way that their core mechanics encourage cooperative storytelling (Bowman \&amp; Lieberoth, 2018) and provide opportunities for meaning-making in a safe fictional world. Research on the effectiveness of TTRPG’s in the context of narrative therapy evidences great potential for building resilience and improving the wellbeing of participants (Enfield, 2007; Zayas \&amp; Lewis, 1986; Kato \&amp; Fujino, 2015). However, throughout the existing literature of games as therapy, less consideration has been spent on the design of the games themselves, primarily using out of the box games such as Dungeons and Dragons (D\&amp;D) as the game world without significant adapting of the work to suit the client (Ascherman, 1993; Blackmon, 1994; Kato et al, 2012; Rosselet \&amp; Stauffer, 2013). Due to the popularity and commercial availability of D\&amp;D, it is no surprise that this is the game of choice for therapists. The potential of a TTRPG is the opportunity of collaborative, agentic storytelling apparently unconstrained by technology and scaffolded by an analogue system of dice and character sheets, but what the game system itself is contributing to the therapeutic experience is not typically examined. This lack of exploration of its specific contributions coupled with the fact that the game itself has been criticized for its overt cultural biases (Garcia, 2017) provides an opportunity for design lead research to ask what more can be done?},

The focus is on how storytelling serves as an educational tool to impart cultural lessons and values to construct a shared understanding, and how building upon a shared understanding is crucial in building stronger and healthier systems of interaction within communities. The paper proposes that the unique incarnation of storytelling in TTRPGs can function as a conduit for transformative learning and development to occur within communities. Through the immersive and collaborative storytelling of TTRPGs, players can learn to work together, solve problems, and develop new perspectives on the world around them. This, in turn, can lead to personal growth and a deeper sense of community and connection. The paper concludes that by embracing these tools of education and transformation, we can build a brighter future for all.},

  abstract = {Halat hisar was a live action role-playing game (larp) organized in Finland in 2016. Halat hisar’s ambition as a larp was to mirror the current situation in Palestine. In larps, participants take on different roles and improvise without the presence of an audience. Larps offer a place where emotions and affectivities are transmitted through the embodiment of characters. Larps offer forms of likenessing, which create new affective states for the players. We conclude that larps can be powerful tools for portraying political alternatives of actual events, and they can serve a role in raising awareness. Larps offer a productive context for studying subjectivities where the focus is on affective relationalities because larps place the participants in social positions where they take up roles that might be inaccessible to them in everyday life. Larps offer a window to visit other ‘world-lines’ – and other ways of living.},

They inform how individuals adopt particular products and services. This elusiveness of value creates a challenge for designers to gauge users’ value preferences, which are personal, contextual and abstract. We propose deliberation as a process to operationalise design for elicitation, reflection and value formation, using Live Action Role Play (LARP). The paper demonstrates how our deliberative LARP precipitates the otherwise ethereal data values to unfold in a social setting. We argue that engaging people in reflecting on and playing out their own value formation offers designers more powerful insights to address complex challenges of data-driven societies. We report on our findings that agency and negotiability are key to transcend the politics of preferences in data practices and thus enhance acceptability.},

Although only role-playing games written in English are considered, the approach taken to understand the structures of attention emergent in gaming is generalizable as a means of investigating the informal social and rhetorical aspects of other kinds of games. The textual and visual rhetorics of numerous games are examined as self-situating lessons for acquiring and focusing interest. The intrinsic gap between reading and following a rule is explored as a phenomenon mediated by rhetoric. Experienced players' reflections on styles and motives are translated into ratios in a grammar of rhetorical invention. Finally, the game designers are interviewed for their professional life histories relative to the development of particular games, and the matters they emphasize are read as configurations of cultural knowledge animated by personal rhetorical resources and heuristics.},

  abstract = {BackgroundAgainst the backdrop of the cognitive-motivational process model proposed by Vollmeyer and Rheinberg (1998), this study investigates how the personality trait need for cognition in combination with a specific situation (short and long version of a live-action simulation game), current motivation, and immersion and flow (mediators) predict the learning outcome in the simulation game EVERYDAY LIFE IN THE CLASSROOM (Starker \& Imhof, 2014).MethodsN = 138 teacher students played the short 2-hour version of the simulation game, and N = 77 played the long 2-day version. Need for cognition, current motivation, immersion, flow, and learning outcome were measured by self-report questionnaires.ResultsA hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the impact of the predictor variables (need for cognition, current motivation, immersion, and flow) on the self-evaluated learning outcome. For the 2-hour group, the predictor variables interest, challenge, and immersion (subscale: engagement) impacted self-reported learning outcome significantly positive. For the 2-day group, significant predictors were need for cognition, interest, and immersion (subscale: engrossment). In comparison of the two game versions, students playing the 2-day version reported significantly higher levels of engagement, engrossment, and learning outcome.ConclusionThe cognitive-motivational process model of learning was partly supported: interest and immersion predict learning outcome in the live-action simulation game. The extended 2-day version of the game leads to higher levels of immersion and higher learning outcome, indicating that a longer timeframe secures the desired effects on learning outcome from simulation games. Further research needs to shed light on the interaction of personality traits and immersion.},

With this in mind, we designed the present study to focus on the experiences and perspectives of autistic people concerning the topic of autistic play. Methods: We conducted a consultation with autistic stakeholders, as well as with parents and teachers of autistic individuals to help us design the study and interview questions. We used semi-structured interviews with 22 autistic adults aged 18–57 years (clinically confirmed diagnosis, n\,=\,21; self-diagnosed, n\,=\,1) who live in the United Kingdom. We analyzed the data using interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify themes. Results: We found important commonalities and differences in the ways that socialization in play, imaginary play, and flow (a state involving intense focus on the play) are experienced. Autistic adults discussed the importance of both solitary play and social play, with solitary play having an important recuperative function. They also reported preferences for parallel play and playing with similar autistic people. They also discussed imaginary play experiences, including social role-play and grounded-in-reality play, and the dual nature of flow experiences during play.

We highlight, for example, the importance of considering the different circumstances under which solitary play or social play are preferred, as well as the importance of taking an individual approach to play. We encourage wider understanding and acceptance of these play preferences and experiences to support autistic people's well-being. Community brief Why is this an important issue? Usually, descriptions of autistic play are negative and are based on what non-autistic people think autistic play should be like. We think that it is important to challenge this by exploring autistic play in a more balanced way and focusing on what autistic people say about their play. What was the purpose of this study? We wanted to find out how autistic adults experience play. We were also interested in how they think their play is different from non-autistic play. What did the researchers do? We asked autistic and non-autistic people to help us design our study and interview questions. We interviewed 22 autistic adults and asked them about their play now or when they were younger. We then analyzed the data using a qualitative method called interpretative phenomenological analysis. This meant that we could identify themes covering the group's views and experiences. What were the results of the study? We found a range of play experiences and different ways in which some autistic adults play. Many autistic adults talked about the importance of both playing by themselves and with others, with solitary play described as being recuperating. Some described preferring play that involves playing nearby other people without necessarily interacting with them directly. Many preferred to play with similar autistic people. Several autistic adults discussed engaging in imaginary play activities such as role-play and preferring play that is based on reality. They also described the benefits and limitations of something called a flow state, which involves intense focus on the play. What do these findings add to what was already known? Our findings highlight how autistic adults like to play and different ways some autistic adults experience play. For example, we highlight the situations where solitary play and social play are preferred, and the importance of understanding that different people like to play in different ways. What are potential weaknesses in the study? We did not involve autistic people beyond consultation. We think that a better understanding of autistic play can come from using approaches with greater autistic involvement, such as co-production. Most of our participants were White, highly educated, and primarily communicate using speech. We do not know if other autistic people would experience play in a similar way. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? Understanding and acceptance of the ways in which autistic people like to play can help support autistic people's well-being. In practice, this involves limiting the use of supports that aim to make autistic people's play “normal” and instead encouraging authentic autistic play.},

Across the globe, video games and interactive media have already been granted their own departments at numerous larger institutions and will increasingly fall under the purview of language and literature departments at smaller schools. This volume considers fundamental ways in which literature can be construed as a game and the benefits of such an approach. The contributors outline pedagogical strategies for integrating the study of video games with the study of literature and consider the intersections of identity and ideology as they relate to literature and ludology. They also address the benefits (and liabilities) of making the process of learning itself a game, an approach that is quickly gaining currency and increasing interest. Every chapter is grounded in theory but focuses on practical applications to develop students' critical thinking skills and intercultural competence through both digital and analog gameful approaches.},

This essay discusses the way that role-playing games construct narrative worlds and compares that to recent theories of fiction based on possible-world models. In both, emphasis is placed on the objects that make up this world. In role-playing games and recent theories of fictional world, this essay argues, emphasis on objects makes possible intertextual comparisons, which in turn help to define and rejuvenate the agency of readers and critics against the backdrop of challenges to that agency by market culture and structuralist literary theory.},

  abstract = {Typical definitions of games and gameplay discount the most integral part of the role-playing game: that fact that it is a game, and that gameplay is very much involved in the process of propelling the narrative forward. It also ignores the principal appeal of role-playing games; that is, the emulation of social drama through fictional situations, or the manifestation of the fundamental human inclination towards play. It can be said, therefore that participants in an RPG cannot simply be regarded as players, nor can they be viewed as passive consumers of a narrative through their control of a character, they are gamers, readers and storytelling agents all in one. Because they role-play, these individuals are immersed in the imaginary world of the RPG, becoming the characters that they control, performing the roles that have been assigned to them (or, in some cases, roles that the player decided to take for himself or herself) in a simulation that is less like writing out a part of a narrative and more like the acting out of a role in a dramatic text on stage. As such, it may be possible to say that the element of role-play in RPGs makes them, in a sense, theatrical. Exploring the commonalities between role-playing games and the act of role-play with theatre and stage performance presents one with the possibility of gaining a new perspective on both forms while taking their unique characteristics into account.},

  abstract = {Although myths and folktales have always contained fantastic elements, literary scholars often date the origins of the modern “fantasy” genre to the 19th century and works such as The King of the Golden River 1851 by John Ruskin, The Princess and the Goblin 1872 by George MacDonald, and The Well at the World’s End 1896 written and illustrated by William Morris.  In the 20th century, one of the most influential works, if not the most influential, is J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. With The Hobbit, Tolkien introduced readers to a vision of a fantasy world that continues to influence the genre today. Dungeons \& Dragons, a table-top role-playing game published by Tactical Studies Rules in 1973, primarily under the guidance of Gary Gygax, derives many of its features from works that were popular when Gygax was growing up such as The Hobbit, as well as pulp fictions such as Conan the Conqueror by Robert E. Howard. With the origins of D\&D being so explicitly rooted in notable works of modern fantasy, D\&D provides a revealing interpretation of the genre. Indeed, although not a conventional literary text, D\&D now arguably has a central place in the development of the genre.  By studying the history and construction of the game, and the various controversies over its development and tropes, we can discover both the depth of influence it has had, both on the conventions and the public perception of the fantasy genre more broadly.},

  abstract = {In the field of communication, there has been a distinct lack of a focus on table-top roleplaying games (TTRPGs), most notably Dungeons and Dragons. Research in this topic could provide a deeper insight into how a shared hobby can help large groups organize meaningful action in response to perceived threats to their ways of life. In the wake of the January 2023 Open Gaming Licence (OGL) Leak, hobby game company Wizards of the Coast, publishers for Dungeons and Dragons, has seen unprecedented drops in sales and customer retention. This report uses thematic analysis to find common patterns and themes present in the reporting of the OGL leak from both traditional media outlets, as well as creators on TikTok. Using the themes found in these sources, the sentiments of the respective comment sections has been recorded to find what effect the actions of Wizards of the Coast during this crisis has had on their brand and the impact it may have on the TTRPG community. The research concluded that many customers within the Dungeons and Dragons community had already harboured negative views of Wizards of the Coast regarding previous business practices and found the leaked OGL was the straw that broke the camels back. This sentiment led to a substantial portion of the Dungeons and Dragons community cancelling subscriptions to D\&amp;D Beyond, a service provided by Wizards of the Coast, and moving their buying power to other competitors within the TTRPG community. This has begun a shift towards the dethroning of Wizards of the Coast and Dungeons and Dragons as the top of an RPG monolith and a renaissance of independently published TTRPGs.},

  abstract = {Although the modern tabletop role playing game (RPG) movement began in 1974 when TSR published the first commercial RPG Dungeons and Dragons, it has been only less around ten years since RPGs have begun to be taken seriously by the academic community. Scholars and teachers alike are only now beginning to look at RPGs as instructional tools, works of art, and means of self-expression and representation. Lately, there has been a quest to discover how online games allow players to explore otherwise hidden parts of their persona, how shooting games integrate physics into their designs, and how RPGs can be considered as interactive narratives. According to Quijano (December 2007), when students play RPGs, they “take the role of characters in a story, and together with the teacher (or game master) they create a cooperative narrative while following a system of preset rules.” Currently, there are very few articles or books dealing with role playing games as narrative media, interactive simulations, or potential instructional resources. This paper will focus on role playing games as interactive narratives and as potential language classroom resources, and will specifically demonstrate that student exposure to RPGs results in the amelioration of the second and foreign language acquisition process.},

Ambas prácticas también están ligadas a hacer presentes, a través de los juegos de apariencia y la simulación corporal, universos narrativos ya sea completos, fragmentados o recombinados. La ponencia propuesta busca explorar estas relaciones y variaciones entre el larp y el cosplay a partir de las teorías de consumo narrativo y de la base de datos propuestas por Eiji Otsuka (2010, 2017) y Hiroki Azuma (2009), respectivamente. En primer lugar, se examinarán los elementos que componen estas prácticas como juegos y como puestas en escena, así como sus funciones mediadora y mediática en los procesos de consumo y producción simbólica narrativa. En segunda instancia, se situará tanto el LARP, en tanto juego de rol, como el cosplay, en una genealogía de universos de sentido transmedia/media mix; examinando algunos puntos clave en el origen, desarrollo y relación de ambas prácticas, siendo que han estado atravesadas e interferidas por mercados e industrias de entretenimiento. Para este propósito, además de los autores mencionados, se recuperará la aproximación genealogista y ecológica de Marc Steinberg (2012) a los sistemas de mediación y mediatización de la cultura popular contemporánea. Both LARP (live-action role-play) and cosplay (embodied representations of characters from popular media culture) are manifestations within the broad spectrum of performance phenomena, understood as the staged conclusion and reactivation of a lived experience. Both practices are also linked to making present, through games of appearance and body simulation, narrative universes, whether they be staged in a complete, fragmented or recombined way. This paper aims to explore the relationships and variations between LARP and cosplay using the theories of narrative consumption (Otsuka, 2010, 2017) and database consumption (Azuma, 2009). First, the symbolic elements and mediatic roles within these practices as stagings and games will be examined. Second, both LARP and cosplay, will be placed in a genealogy of transmedia/media mix universes; examining some key points in the origin, development and relationship of both practices, such as how they have been informed and interfered by cultural and entertainment markets and industries. For this purpose, in addition to the aforementioned theories, Marc Steinberg’s (2012) genealogical approach to popular culture media ecologies will be recovered.},

Pour ce mémoire, un jeu de rôle a donc été expérimenté en classe de 1ère ES afin d'analyser les apprentissages permis par cette pratique. Il s'agit du jeu de rôle Cuba 1962, simulant la crise de Cuba pendant la guerre froide, opposant des acteurs du conflit, interprétés par les élèves. En tant qu'élèves-acteurs, ils ont dû prendre des décisions pour résoudre la crise de Cuba, notamment pendant les négociations, et ainsi comprendre que les hommes du passé étaient des acteurs. Ces décisions déterminaient le futur des personnages qu'ils interprétaient. Ainsi, ils ont pu comprendre que ces hommes du passé avaient un futur incertain. Ce jeu a pu simuler une histoire différente et soulever un large champ des possibles, qui auraient pu advenir en octobre 1962. En comparant après le jeu, leur résultat avec la réalité historique, les élèves ont pu constater l'incertitude de cet événement du passé, dépendant de l'action des hommes.},

  abstract = {Costume Agency in German Larp has two aims. First, it contributes to the understanding of costumes as collaborators in a larp network. Second, it shows that the change towards a network perspective expands the understanding of games as relational processes. An actor-network analysis of the costume builds on first-hand data from three larps. Data analysis required a set of qualitative methods based upon participatory observation and qualitative interviews. The results of the analysis are: 1. Larp works, because the costume contributes to role playing. 2. The costume contributes when it changes its arrangement of material actors to fulfill the demands of the network. 3. Costume contribution demands changes from narrative and ludic actors as well and the result of these negotiations is a development of the network. 4. The development of the three observed larp networks resulted in costumes that work towards the 360° illusion ideal, change game rules, and raise the popularity of one favored narrative genre: Fantasy. Following the costume and tracing its work, reveals how larp as a network of heterogeneous actors structures itself. These processes become visible with an actor-network perspective that reaches beyond the division of agency as being driven by human or material actors.},

The art therapy process provided the patient with an outlet for his anger and depression through the art media. Through problem-solving skills and decision making during the sessions, the patient gained a sense of mastery and control within his limited and restricted environment. It is suggested that art therapy serves as a creative tool in which adolescents can express feelings and issues crucial to their recovery. The art process further aids adolescents in developing their sense of identity and self-esteem, as well as preserving their autonomy by giving them a sense of mastery and control. It is concluded that both the therapist and patient need to work together to promote healing and growth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

It also includes corresponding abstractive summaries collected from the Fandom wiki. The dataset is linguistically unique in that the narratives are generated entirely through player collaboration and spoken interaction. For each dialogue, there are a large number of turns, multiple abstractive summaries with varying levels of detail, and semantic ties to the previous dialogues. In addition, we provide a data augmentation method that produces 34,243 summary-dialogue chunk pairs to support current neural ML approaches, and we provide an abstractive summarization benchmark and evaluation.},

The first ‘adventure’ (a computer game genre that is paradigmatic for today’s game designs) started out as a simulation of cave exploration and today ‘caves, caverns and dungeons’ are still among the most used topics in game narration, artwork and design. From Tomb Raider to Uncharted, from The Bard’s Tale to World of Warcraft, the exploration of cave-like structures seems to be an integral part of a great number of games that were present from the beginning. In this chapter it is argued that there are intrinsic reasons why computer games maintain such a close relationship with speleological themes of all kinds.},

  abstract = {Stories in released games are still based largely on static and predetermined structures, despite decades of academic work to make them more dynamic. Making game narratives more playable is an important step in the evolution of games and playable media as culturally relevant art forms. In the same way interactive systems help students learn about complicated subjects like physics in a more intuitive and immediate way than static texts, more dynamic interactive stories open up new ways of understanding people and situations. Such dreams remain mostly unrealized in released and playable games.In this dissertation I will describe a number of design and technical solutions to the problem of creating more expressive and dynamic storygames, informed by a practice-based approach to game production. I will first define a framework for the analysis of games, including especially the terms storygame (a playable system with units of narrative where the understanding of the interconnectedness between story and system is crucial) and the notion of narrative logics (the set of processes that define how player input affects the next unit of story presented by the system). I will exercise this framework on an existing and well-known storygame genre, the adventure game, and use it to make a number of claims about the mechanics and dynamics of narratives in this genre that are borne out by an analysis of how contemporary games adopting some of its aesthetics succeed and fail. I will then describe three emerging storygame modes that are still in the process of being defined, developing a critical framework for each informed by close readings and historical analysis, and considering what design and technical innovations are required to fully realize the new mode's potential. These three modes I discuss are sculptural fiction (which shifts the focus from navigating to building a structure of narrative nodes), social simulation (games that explore the possibility space created by a set of simulated characters and rules for social interaction), and collaborative storygames (in which the lexia are generated at least in part by the participants during play). Each theoretical chapter is paired with a case study of one or several fully completed and released games I have created or co-created in that mode, to see how these design ideas were realized and technical advancements implemented in practice. I will conclude each section with applied advice for game makers hoping to work in these new spaces, and new technological developments that will help storygames continue to evolve and prosper.},

  abstract = {We know that objects shape thought, as bearers of meaning and as the focal points of memory. Our question as artists and larpwrights was how those objects might affect the act of thinking itself. From this initial thought, we developed the notion of Living Objects — elements created to cause people to have strange new ideas and awaken thoughts beyond those prompted by reason alone — and sought to employ them in the micro role-playing games we presented to people in Rio de Janeiro in order to stimulate such an exploration of fantasy, desire, and daydreaming. The theoretical underpinning of our work relies upon the recovery of wonder discussed by critics like Kareem, Brain, and others. Within this endeavor, we presented Living Objects as fragments that provide a joke (witz). Witz is a concept explored by the Jena Romantic philosophers, in which poetic fragments of words influence thought or cause strangeness in normal ways of thinking, and cause derangement in the current logic. With this, they enable new creative paths for imagination. In doing so, we drew upon the cultural heritage of the city of Rio de Janeiro, especially the art of Bispo do Rosário, who produced a number of distinctive artistic objects during the decades that he was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. And in this work, we focus especially on a piece called “The Presentation Cloak.” These objects are central elements of micro role-playing games that we createdto encourage people to experience the stories linked to the life of Bispo do Rosário and the spaces he imagined about Rio de Janeiro. These games also inspired the participants to create stories from these objects, realizing how the influence of these elements stimulates imagination, belief in wonder, and immersion in the cultural universe created by Bispo do Rosário.},

  abstract = {This thesis is the culmination of little ideas from nearly a decade of my life, all coming together to form a larger, cohesive world in which I hope to create a great many enthralling campaigns of Dungeons \& Dragons. I was inspired to create this work by a class which essentially kicked me in the pants to begin writing just a piece of history too far back for anyone to remember. This class, “Worldbuilding in Science Fiction and Fantasy” taught by professor Matt Bell, led me to create the beginning of a world which I had been toying with slowly for many years prior. At the start of the class, I had a map of one continent, a loose idea of the political workings of that continent, and several landmarks with unexplained and mysterious histories. By the end, I had created two more continents, an explanation for some of the landmarks, and many many more threads to toy with. The Complete History of Verités and Her Peoples is intended to be a piece of writing within the world of Verités, kept in the highly guarded personal library of a lich by the name of Visher Delcanis. This library will very likely be a location for players in my world to seek out, as the information contained within all holds immense power. It is my hope that players will face a threat so outlandish or powerful that they will have to turn to these forgotten histories to find a solution, or perhaps even just understand what the threat they are facing is.},

Collection of measures relating to knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and perception of the health and safety climate took place at baseline and immediately after the intervention. Participants’ average safety knowledge at the end of the training was significantly better than the initial level, indicating that the training improved workers’ knowledge level.},

Scholars analyzed it from a social constructionist perspective, citing a number of factors and developments whose confluence contributed to this high-visibility moral panic. The authors examine those factors that were deemed of importance in the rise of the Satanism scare, to ascertain why the scare seems to have waned in recent years. Particular attention is given to developments within the justice system, the professions of psychology and psychiatry, and the waning of the Anti-Cult Movement to explain why the panic lost momentum. Other contributing factors are also discussed, including the weakening of Christian Fundamentalism as a force in society and the shift of attention of the mass media and the general public to other topics. Attention also is given to various behaviors among youth that have redefined and contributed to the maintenance of Satanism as a social phenomenon of note.},

  abstract = {In this study, the authors investigate role-playing game design through the lens of instructional design practice to probe the ecosystem of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) and their applied use for learning. A qualitative thematic analysis approach is used to systematically catalog and categorize all possible player actions, called ludemes, from the 5th Edition of Dungeons \&amp; Dragons (D\&amp;D). Through this analysis, the interplay of game mechanics, player actions, and rules of TTRPGs are explored, unveiling their potential to stimulate various psychological, environmental, and behavioral factors that positively influence learning processes. Specifically, this study’s analysis of a game’s ludemes (i.e., player actions) exposes the interrelationships, congruence, and combinations of actions with various learning processes. The identified categories of ludemes in the study pave the way toward a working vocabulary and framework for future research in the application of game-based learning and its potential to catalyze meaningful learning outcomes. From a global instructional standpoint, this study highlights the role of pedagogical affordances, such as collaborative storytelling and problem solving skills, theorizing how TTRPGs can promote cognitive, metacognitive, affective, social, and cultural learning. Toward these goals, the authors posit that role-playing, with its complex dynamics and compelling narratives, offers a robust and natural conduit for learning.},

It was an essential read for me while directing and producing the Official D\&D documentary but I’d recommend it to anyone regardless of the subject material. It’s a wild and fun ride through the turbulent history of one the most influential brands in our lifetime." - JOE MANGANIELLOCo-created by wargame enthusiasts Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, the original Dungeons \& Dragons role-playing game released by TSR (Tactical Studies Rules) in 1974 created a radical new medium: the role-playing game. For the next two decades, TSR rocketed to success, producing multiple editions of D\&D, numerous settings for the game, magazines, video games, New York Times bestselling novels by Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, and R. A. Salvatore, and even a TV show! But by 1997, a series of ruinous choices and failed projects brought TSR to the edge of doom―only to be saved by their fiercest competitor, Wizards of the Coast, the company behind the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering.Unearthed from Ben Riggs’s own adventurous campaign of in-depth research, interviews with major players, and acquisitions of secret documents, Slaying the Dragon reveals the true story of the rise and fall of TSR. Go behind the scenes of their Lake Geneva headquarters where innovative artists and writers redefined the sword and sorcery genre, managers and executives sabotaged their own success by alienating their top talent, ignoring their customer fanbase, accruing a mountain of debt, and agreeing to deals which, by the end, made them into a publishing company unable to publish so much as a postcard.As epic and fantastic as the adventures TSR published, Slaying the Dragon is the legendary tale of the rise and fall of the company that created the role-playing game world.},

A hypothesis was developed that higher levels of empathy would be found in individuals who fantasy role-play based upon previous research in hypnosis such as J. R. Hilgard’s (1970) imaginative involvement hypothesis, research into the “fantasy prone” personality type (Wilson \& Barber, 1981), and the empathic involvement hypothesis (Wickramasekera II \& Szlyk, 2003). The participants in the current study were 127 fantasy role-players who volunteered and completed the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (empathy) and the Tellegen Absorption Scale (absorption). The results demonstrated that those who play fantasy role-playing games scored significantly higher than the comparison group on the IRI scale of empathy, confirming the hypothesis that fantasy role-players report experiencing higher levels of empathic involvement with others. Correlational analysis between the measures demonstrated a significant positive correlation between empathy and absorption (r = .43, p {$<$} .001). These results collectively suggest that fantasy role-players have a uniquely empathically-imaginative style. The results also confirm and extend previous findings on the relationship between empathy and absorption as predicted by the Empathic Involvement Hypothesis (Wickramasekera II \& Szlyk, 2003).},

  abstract = {The dungeon and megadungeon are imagined spaces of a complex and interconnected network that emerged in fantasy tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) from the 1970s. As a space distinctive to early TTRPGs it is characterised by asymmetry between the dungeon as an object of design, and the dungeon as a practice of play. The discourse of games manuals, independent publications and blogs emerging from the TTRPG scene tracks the origins and evolution of these procedural and labyrinthine spaces, and the distinct spatiality of the megadungeon as a geographical object. The space of the megadungeon can be mapped onto a Lefebvrian triad of spatial production: it exists as a representation of space produced by a dungeon master or algorithmic generation that forms an infrastructure of play; it exists as a spatial practice emerging out of the unique experience of players traversing the megadungeon; and it forms a space of representation by seeking to imagine the megadungeon as a living fictional world, intersecting with the assumptions about spatial norms and relations originating in tropes of fantasy fiction. Surveying these trends in conversation with recent insights from human geography illustrates the distinct spatiality of the megadungeon that is derived from its origins in TTRPG play. This brings forward important questions for the utility of the megadungeon as a metaphor for digital media ecologies, and asks whether the metaphor could be extended to enrich conceptual debates in human geography.},

  abstract = {Furries, self-identified fans of anthropomorphism, report feeling significant social stigma. As a result, furries rarely reveal their furry identity to mental health professionals, for fear of judgment or disapproval. Improving health practitioners' familiarity with the furry identity may improve the quality of care for furries seeking treatment for unrelated conditions. Six focus groups were conducted over three days at a furry convention in the Midwest United States to study the furry identity (59 self-identified furries ages 18 to 41). The authors define and describe the demographics of important distinctions within the furry community and discuss the furry identity and liken it to sexual orientation, noting that the stigma furries face—worsened by media that exaggerate fringe and rare behaviors—has made it challenging for furries to live authentically for fear of ostracism, violence, and discrimination. These factors have resulted in furries' reluctance to disclose their identities. Highlighting communication challenges, the authors discuss strategies for health professionals to engage with furries in a clinical setting and to uphold unconditional positive regard.},

  abstract = {This essay examines the relationship between genre and franchise though a discussion of the Dragonlance series, a collection of pre-fabricated adventures for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons adapted into a series of novels. Because of the sheer number of these novels (approximately 200), the fiction set in the AD\&D campaign setting known as Krynn far surpasses the scope of the original adventures in terms of narrative, character, geographical location, and historical situation. The sprawling nature of the novels, which implicitly seek to be an exhaustive account of Krynn and everything that happens there, would make Dragonlance one of the longest series in the history of generic fantasy. However, as I demonstrate, the development of the Dragonlance narrative takes place in the context of a franchise that turns away from the conventions of genre fantasy. The double origin of Dragonlance as both a setting for adventures in the AD\&D game system and as a series of fantasy novels creates both the mechanistic feel of the early novels (those that were adapted directly from the pre-fabricated adventures and even from actual gaming sessions) as well as opportunities for the novels to eventually break from the conventions of generic fantasy, especially the latter’s particular concern with endings. My consideration of Dragonlance not only offers a consideration of the merely generic texts with which this special issue concerns itself, but also a means by which critics might consider franchises as objects.},

  abstract = {For some Dungeons Dragons (DD) players, the death of a beloved character, especially if that death isn't heroic, is like losing a dear friend. That might make some people squirm and worry about gamers. In DD, unlike video games, it typically takes years and years to advance a character to levels of significance. According to Socrates, the life of philosophy is a life of the mind. Or as he would likely put it, a life of the soul. Death, according to Socrates, is “separation of the soul from the body”. This chapter talks about how the death of a PC can be an invitation to think about passion and detachment, and how the creation of a new PC can be an invitation to think about fairness and justice. Does playing DD really lend itself to thinking about such things? Of course!},

We propose to host a workshop at CHI 2023 which will connect CHI attendees of various disciplines interested in this topic, with the outcome to understand how edu-larp might be an effective way of augmenting existing teaching and research within HCI. During the workshop, attendees will participate in numerous edu-larp exercises designed to introduce and orient them to the concept, and facilitate discussion about the different ways edu-larp can be leveraged in the broad domain of HCI.},

The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the pedagogical benefits of the use of role-playing games in the classroom, illustrated with various experiences that have been put into practice and that confirm the pedagogical dimension of the activity and (2) to make a methodological proposal that offers solutions applicable in the classroom and that results in a guide to take the first steps in the application of role playing games in that context. It has been identified that the pedagogical benefits of the use of role-playing games in the classroom revolve around different dimensions, such as the development of soft skills, the application of the contents learned in a guided worldbuilding process and the possibility of playing with the curricular contents through a setting created specifically by the teacher. The conclusions of the methodological proposal show that, depending on the pedagogical axis being pursued, the challenges faced by the teacher are different. The aim of all this is to highlight the value of a playful activity which, although little known, can provide a series of important benefits for pupils with the appropriate adaptations to the classroom.},

In this task, the participants have to decide which two of four rotated figures match the target figure. The dependent measures were performance speed and accuracy. In our exploratory investigation, we further examined midline frontal theta band activation, parietal alpha band activation, and parietal alpha band asymmetry in EEG as indicator for the chosen rotation strategy. Additionally, we explored the gender influence on performance and EEG activation, although a very small female sample section was given. The expected gender difference concerning performance accuracy was negated by expertise in pen and paper role-playing women, while the gender-specific difference in performance speed was preserved. Moreover, gender differences concerning electro-cortical measures revealed differences in rotation strategy, with women using top-down strategies compared to men, who were using top-down strategies and active inhibition of associative cortical areas. These strategy uses were further moderated by expertise, with higher expertise leading to more pronounced activation patters, especially during successful performance. However, due to the very limited sample size, the findings of this explorative study have to be interpreted cautiously.},

Being a game played through an extended series of performative utterances, researchers are able to observe the expression, experimentation, and exploration of identities as a negotiated process among players. Of particular interest are the expression of identities that may be marginalized and thus closeted by bearers. For TRPG players with stigmatized identities, the game serves as a back-channel function for enacting these identity performances. This study found that players used the game to experiment with, express, and explore through a confluence of validating communication to facilitate authentic or sincere play. As a result, players more fully immersed themselves in the narrative experience which was used to integrate underdeveloped facets of identity into their primary identity. These findings support the forwarding of theoretical and material contributions that communication scholars can find by studying TRPG spaces, particularly those used by people with marginalized identities.},

Drawing on SCHUTZian accounts of intersubjectivity and communication we understand maps as one of many strategies to deal with the problem of "medium transcendencies" posed by communicating with others. The methodology of "sociological hermeneutics" (SOEFFNER) is introduced as means of approaching maps and the interactions they are involved in. In our analyses of maps used in role-playing games we can then show that maps are not only a means of locating oneself but also a means of actively creating a meaningful place in which we are entangled. Thus, maps help to form a sense of belonging in (imaginary) territories which are only given to us in mediated form.},

  abstract = {Gifted children develop asynchronously, often advanced for their age cognitively, but at or between their chronological and mental ages socially and emotionally (Robinson, 2008). In order to help gifted children and adolescents develop and practice social and emotional self-regulation skills, we investigated the use of an Adlerian play therapy approach during pen-and-paper roleplaying games. Additionally, we used Goffman’s (1961, 1974) social role identification and distance to encourage participants to experiment with new identities. Herein, we propose a psychosocial model of interactions during role-playing games based on Goffman's theory and Adlerian play therapy techniques, and suggest that role-playing games are an effective way of intervening with gifted children and adolescents to improve their intra- and interpersonal skills. We specifically targeted intrapersonal skills of exercising creativity, becoming self-aware, and setting individual goals by raising participants’ awareness of their privately logical reasons for making decisions and their levels of social interest. We also targeted their needs and means of seeking significance in the group to promote collaboration and interaction skills with other gifted peers through role analysis, embracement, and distancing. We report results from a case study and conclude that role-playing games deserve more attention, both from researchers and clinical practitioners, because they encourage change while improving young clients' social and emotional development.},

Il apparaît cependant qu’aucune étude n’ait jamais formalisé ces moyens. L’objectif du présent travail est donc de faire ressortir les modalités de médiatisation et de spectatorisation des actual plays afin de les examiner et de voir si celles-ci font appel à une standardisation ou une fragmentation des pratiques. Pour ce faire, nous avons réalisé une analyse comparative exploratoire sur la base d’une grille d’analyse créée ad hoc. La comparaison semble dégager un modèle de pratiques standardisées dans les actual plays.},

While participants did acknowledge that the rules were important, the rules themselves function more as paratexts, or guidelines. They functioned to create a consistent, understandable environment within which to create a narrative, but participants recognized that if these guidelines hamper the enjoyment or flow of the game and story they could be changed or ignored for the players’ benefit. Furthermore, players were more likely to break the rules or allow others to do so if there was a creative and interesting narrative purpose, as it was important to allow all players to have agency and input in the narrative and to ensure that the story itself was enjoyable for all involved.},

The chapter goes on to survey the narrative, cinematic and critical work on women as vampires. As many of the texts were developed as part of the fantasy role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade , this chapter also surveys how fantasy role-playing develops unpublished texts that can make fruitful ground for performance studies. The second chapter examines the rehearsal and production process in comparison to the work of Glenda Dickerson and other feminist directors.},

  abstract = {This qualitative study is a video-cued multivocal ethnography that analyzed the clinical reasoning and perspectives of psychotherapists using Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPG) as a therapeutic treatment for children and adolescents diagnosed with Autism Spectrum conditions. With a growing number of TRPG therapists nationwide using this modality in their clinical practices, this study aimed to develop a clearer understanding of the ways in which their therapeutic orientation, gaming practices, and knowledge of Autism Spectrum Conditions informs their use of TRPG psychotherapy with Autistic clients. Research that focuses on clinical decision-making and the knowledge that informs clinical interventions and technique generally refers to these as “clinical reasoning”. By observing therapy and interviewing therapists about their clinical practice, this study collected data about the different types of clinical reasoning TRPG therapists use when working with Autistic clients. Through the use of video-cued multivocal clinical ethnography, one TRPG therapist was observed and interviewed as she conducted TRPG therapy with Autistic clients and described the clinical reasoning behind the design and implementation of this treatment modality. Using ethnographic semi-structured interviewing and Brief Structured Recall (BSR), the video footage of the TRPG therapy served as a video cue for interviews with three other TRPG therapists, allowing the therapists to authentically reflect on the theoretical underpinnings behind their clinical judgement and decisions. As Autism psychotherapies have been expanding to include approaches integrative of behavioral as well as psychodynamic orientations, TRPG therapy as a “semi-directive” treatment offers an emergent treatment option that integrates directive and non-directive approaches to Autism treatment. TRPG therapists discussed the ongoing tension between non-directive and directive approaches to treatment, which simultaneously mirrored historical debates between these two approaches in play psychotherapy for Autistic patients. The results of this study reveal how TRPG therapists’ perspectives diverge from mainstream and previously held clinical views on Autism diagnosis and treatment. The results of this study show the alternative ways in which TRPG therapists view Autism symptomatology (i.e. sensorimotor needs, Theory of Mind, sociality) and the evolving nature of Autistic comportment that emerges through and is mediated by player immersion in the gaming space and interactions with the game’s structure and mechanics. Operating both as Dungeon Master and Therapist, the TRPG therapists discussed how they simultaneously utilized and integrated these multiple roles with competing paradigmatic perspectives while grappling with gaming, clinical, and cultural perspectives of Autism diagnosis and Autism treatment.},

Using a mixed-methods approach, this ISDiP follows a team of invested school community members as they planned, implemented, studied, and reflected on the outcomes of initiating targeted social and emotional learning interventions to 16 students from a small alternative school in Anchorage, Alaska. Through a 90-day cycle, the School's Network Improvement Community (NIC) organized and executed an after-school SEL club after data on a district-wide survey indicated that social and emotional learning (SEL) was a necessary focus for the school context. The NIC utilized a self-assessment SEL screener, anecdotal observations, as well as parent, teacher, and student testimonies to justify the outcomes of this study. The researcher found that tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are a viable, effective, and fun way to help students develop their social and emotional skills. This result was evident based on the mySAEBRS survey results, which demonstrated an average increase of 6.6\% across all participants. This data was justified further by the anecdotal observations made by a diverse pool of stakeholders. Based on these results, the NIC was able to expand the SEL/TTRPG intervention to their entire school community and would like to encourage other school contexts to do so as well.},

  abstract = {This study examines collaborative storytelling in Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) and computer mediated communication (CMC) friendship maintenance among long-term friends. The theoretical foundations for this study are the Communicated Narrative Sense-Making (CNSM) Theory (Koenig Kellas, 2018) and the concept of co-telling (Mandelbaum, 1987). For this study, 15 individuals who have played D\&D online for more than six months with friends they have met in person participated in in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify two emergent themes. The theme of styles of collaborative storytelling, which looks at the different ways that collaborative narratives are shaped in D\&D and the focus of the told narratives, provided insight the process of collaborative storytelling in online D\&D groups. The theme online collaborative storytelling as “more than,” refers to the finding that the experience of stories collaboratively told in D\&D as real, as working together, and as a commitment work together to make online D\&D feel like a more meaningful mode of CMC friendship maintenance. This study expands the research on CNSM theory and co-telling to include fictional and improvisational stories as meaningful types of collaborative storytelling that can influence relationship quality and relationship maintenance.},

  abstract = {Playing satisfies basic human needs such as deepening social relationships (Melton et al., 2019) and experiencing an ideal self’s characteristics (Przybylski et al., 2012). In addition, games foster student engagement through the use of intrinsic motivation, critical thinking skills, and the use of creative problem solving (Boghian et al., 2019; Quaye \& Haper, 2015; Marinho et al., 2019; Thangmak, 2019). Thus, it is no surprise that there has been a recent increase in the exploration of gamification as a pedagogical tool (Furdu et al., 2017; Hanus \& Fox, 2015; Koivisto \& Hamari, 2014; Sanchez et al., 2019). This article explores role-playing games as pedagogical tools for educating student trainings, such as an R.A. conflict management workshop, a hazing prevention seminar, a teaching assistant orientation, a bystander intervention program to combat sexual assault, etc. Furthermore, it will reimagine the traditional approach to role-play activities in educational settings and suggest slight modifications to create more realistic and educative experiences.},

  location = {Baltimore, MD},
  abstract = {Is there a significant difference in attitude between immersion in a game and immersion in a movie or novel? What are the new possibilities for representation offered by the emerging technology of virtual reality? As Marie-Laure Ryan demonstrates in Narrative as Virtual Reality, the questions raised by new, interactive technologies have their precursors and echoes in pre-electronic literary and artistic traditions. Formerly a culture of immersive ideals—getting lost in a good book, for example—we are becoming, Ryan claims, a culture more concerned with interactivity. Approaching the idea of virtual reality as a metaphor for total art, Narrative as Virtual Reality applies the concepts of immersion and interactivity to develop a phenomenology of reading.  Ryan's analysis encompasses both traditional literary narratives and the new textual genres made possible by the electronic revolution of the past few years, such as hypertext, interactive movies and drama, digital installation art, and computer role-playing games. Interspersed among the book's chapters are several "interludes" that focus exclusively on either key literary texts that foreshadow what we now call "virtual reality," including those of Baudelaire, Huysmans, Ignatius de Loyola, Calvino, and science-fiction author Neal Stephenson, or recent efforts to produce interactive art forms, like the hypertext "novel" Twelve Blue, by Michael Joyce, and I'm Your Man, an interactive movie. As Ryan considers the fate of traditional narrative patterns in digital culture, she revisits one of the central issues in modern literary theory—the opposition between a presumably passive reading that is taken over by the world a text represents and an active, deconstructive reading that imaginatively participates in the text's creation.},

Nos jeunes patients, adolescents fascinés par les vampires, semblent nous dire combien ce mythe met en musique une certaine réalité psychique et culturelle. Nos travaux sur l’évolution des modèles familiaux semblent pouvoir nous donner des pistes pour comprendre cette fascination contemporaine à l’égard du vampire. Il est étonnant de voir combien les traits prêtés à ces créatures légendaires font écho aux caractéristiques psychopathologiques contemporaines que nous avons déjà décrites et mises en lien avec l’évolution des valeurs tant dans notre société que dans la famille.

It was used for the collection of the data a partner-demographic questionnaire and a semi-open interview; the last one was analyzed based on certain categories that started from the themes that were raised. The categories demonstrated that RPG is viewed as an improvised theater, a leisure activity, a therapy, a personality projection, a facilitator of personal relationships and as an opportunity to meet friends. It was certain that the players’ main motivation was friendship, the will of being with the game companions. The game of RPG possesses positive characteristics as much as negatives, and the difference would be in the way it is used. The result of the research makes way for future studies on that kind of game that is already inserted in the mass culture.},

Para alcançar o objetivo de evidenciar na narrativa do professor (que considera sua prática com jogos insubordinada criativa) de manifestações de ações de insubordinação criativa, incluindo as auto-insubordinações criativas, utilizamos os aportes teóricos do ensino de probabilidade, do ensino a partir de jogos e da insubordinação criativa. Como resultados foram encontrados indícios de subversão responsável que alargam as categorias consideradas na literatura, tais como a visibilidade profissional, além de uma reflexão sobre códigos de vestimenta profissional. Esta pesquisa procura contribuir para a continuidade das discussões sobre a docência (e suas insubordinações criativas) em pesquisas em Educação Matemática. The study of the Theory of Probability is placed from the perspective of playfulness, based on Role Playing Games (RPG). A teaching practice is narrated in which an attempt was made to structure the knowledge of probability and the discovery by second- -year high school students at a public school in Rio de Janeiro, of how the sampling space behaves. To achieve the objective of showing in the teacher’s narrative, who considers his practice with games as creative insubordinate, manifestations of responsible subversion actions, including creative self-insubordination, we use the theoretical contributions of teaching probability, teaching from games and of creative insubordination. In the literature on the subject, categories of teaching actions considered creative insubordinate were searched. Confronting the teacher’s narrative with these categories, as a result, indications of responsible subversion were found that widen such categories, such as professional visibility, in addition to a reflection on dress codes in the teacher’s workplace. This investigation seeks to contribute to the continuity of discussions about teaching (and its creative insubordinations) in research in Mathematics Education.},

  abstract = {This contribution reflects the results of the research carried out during the 2018/19 academic year in relation to the introduction of role-playing games in the didactics of Ancient History in Higher Education.Given the problems detected in different degrees with respect to new students and adapting to the demands of competency learning, a role-playing game with historical content, Iberia, has been designed as a methodological alternative. This game has been applied in different groups and its impact on students has been evaluated as a didactic resource when teaching Ancient History in general and the Iberian Peninsula in particular. During the 2018/19 academic year, a pilot test of the designed game has been carried out with nine groups of between 30 and 60 students and three of them have been taken as a sample, being surveyed about the activity through a questionnaire prepared by the teaching team. The results obtained from the pilot test through direct observation and the elaboration and use of a questionnaire raise a clear acceptance of the resource for practical classes, bringing the student closer to specific topics such as the economic and social processes of Ancient History of the Iberian Peninsula, and has led to an improvement in the understanding of these by students.},

  abstract = {Situated at the interstices of game studies, adaptation scholarship, and literary theory, this dissertation puts forth a theoretical framework for effectively analyzing literary game adaptations (that is, playable digital or analog systems that are based upon a work or works of literature) as expressive intertextual systems which facilitate aesthetic experiences. By integrating contemporary game studies with filmic adaptation studies and literary theory, I argue that game adaptations allow us to see how games, adaptations, and indeed all texts can be productively conceived of as Barthesian networks of meaning: collections of interacting formal, narrative, intertextual, and contextual elements from which a user’s experience arises. Doing so destabilizes the primacy of concepts that are so often used to justify hierarchical relationships between “high art” and popular culture, opening up new interpretations of texts which do not lend themselves to analysis via traditional literary or cinematic methodologies. Thinking of adaptations in terms of the systemized relationships between texts, intertexts, and the user rather than as merely derivative copies of a single “original” also redefines the classically hierarchical relationship between adaptations and their sources that has plagued adaptation studies discourse from its inception. Through my readings of a variety of digital and analog games based on William Shakespeare’s Hamlet (Ryan North’s gamebook To Be or Not to Be), J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit (Beam Software’s Hobbit text-adventure), Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (Storybrewers’ tabletop roleplaying game Good Society), and Henry David Thoreau’s Walden (Tracy Fullerton’s contemplative digital “walking simulator” Walden, a game), I illustrate how thinking of texts as systems affords interpretatively productive play, encouraging users to reinterpret, revise, and remix culture to their own ends.},

  abstract = {AI Advancements have augmented casual writing and story generation, but their usage poses challenges in collaborative storytelling. In role-playing games such as Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D), composing prompts using generative AI requires a technical understanding to generate ideal results, which is difficult for novices. Thus, emergent narratives organically developed based on player actions and decisions have yet to be fully utilized. This paper envisions the use of generative AI in transforming storytelling into an interactive drama using dynamic and immersive narratives. First, we describe scenarios where narratives are created and character conversations are designed within an overarching fantasy disposition. Then, we recommend design guidelines to help create tools using generative AI in interactive storytelling. Lastly, we raise questions on its potential impact on player immersion and cognitive load. Our contributions may be expanded within the broader interactive storytelling domain, such as speech-conversational AI and persona-driven chatbots.},

Specifically this study asked: In what ways do fantasy play and participation in the role-playing community benefit participants? This study aimed to address the lack of social work literature regarding the emotional and social benefits that roleplaying games provide consumers. Data were collected from interviews with six individuals who regularly engage in tabletop role-playing games. The study asked open ended questions regarding participants' experiences with the role-playing community, thematic and emotional content experienced within the fantasy setting, and benefits participants felt they'd gained from role-playing games and access to that community. The key findings of this study were that community access and feelings of belonging were an important part of the role-playing experience, that participants reported the context of fantasy play decreased their social anxiety which allowed them to interact with their own emotional content meaningful ways, and that role experimentation through their characters led to improved social skills in all participants.},

Appuyée d’une enquête qualitative par questionnaires conduite sur les réseaux sociaux du Québec, cette recherche confirme une opinion favorable et un virage déjà amorcé vers l’incorporation de périphériques et de logiciels autour de la table de jeu de rôle. Seuls le jeu distanciel et les tables virtuelles font moins consensus, eux qui amenuisent le contact humain et le rapport à l’objet tangible, ou qui rapprochent le jeu de rôle sur table un peu trop près du jeu vidéo.    Ce mémoire analyse les tensions entre jeu et récit à l’intérieur de l’écosystème social et observe comment ces systèmes expérientiels interdépendants sont affectés par le choix et la manipulation des dispositifs technologiques qui sont introduits. Il place le designer industriel orienté vers l’utilisateur comme un maître de jeu 2.0 qui se sert de l’objet numérique pour se rapprocher de l’humain.   Pen and paper roleplaying is more than forty years old and it undertakes its first technological revolution only now. Building on a qualitative survey conducted over Québec social media, this research confirms a shift toward using digital hardware and software in roleplaying games and a positive opinion in general about them. Only long distance play sessions with virtual tabletops garner less extensive agreement, where human contact and emotional relationship with dice and miniatures are hampered, or because they bring tabletop roleplaying too closely to video games.    This master’s degree thesis investigates the tension between game and story inside a social ecosystem and observes how interlinked experiential systems are affected by choosing technological devices. It situates the user-centered industrial designer as a game master 2.0 that wields digital objects to get closer to human players.},

  abstract = {Folklore may be transmitted and diffused through many forms of media, adding to pre-established meanings and interpretations. This may be accomplished through the reinterpretation of mythological or legendary figures or stories in popular media, such as video games, novels, or cinema. Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons \& Dragons are often built on a foundation of mythology and folklore, which players use as inspiration to craft their own shared stories and experiences, allowing for endless reinterpretations and transmission of those interpretations. Through forms of subtle performative acts, players may experience different resistances to the narratives of dominant society. These resistances present themselves in different ways but may come as an active choice by the players or because of underlying shifts in framework or perspective. Medusa has become a symbol of feminine rage and resistance against Patriarchal institutions, which has been reflected in the developing resources of TTRPG material. This allows players to engage with that resistance on personal scales through performance in a safe, imaginative space. The types and styles of games that players engage with are varied, but many have correlations with other forms of media. These cross-media genres bring their own motifs and underlying frameworks into the TTRPG medium. Inspired by Dark Souls, the Soulslike subgenre provides a series of rules heavily, and subtly, influenced by European Christian motifs reinterpreted through a Japanese framework in a form of hybridization. The genre conventions that have been translated into TTRPG mechanics allow players to explore these hybridizations which themselves act as a resistance against globalization in a type of cross-pollination of cultural elements. Recent additions to the TTRPG library are also showing a shift in the outlook on accessibility and respectability of the player-base. Older TTRPGs often succumb to Orientalist and insensitive approaches to non-Western cultures, using stereotypes that often misrepresent real-world cultures. Efforts are being made to create worlds and stories that do not rely on caricature to be compelling, typically through the inclusion of authors and cultural consultants from marginalized groups to better resist dominant views.},

The reference guide proper is preceded by two informative sections, "What is a Role-Playing Game?" and "The History of Role-Playing Games." The game descriptions are divided into 22 genres (and subgenres), and include fantasy (by far the most numerous), science fiction, comic book superheroes, espionage, and westerns. Each section begins with a brief descriptive overview and Schick's list of recommended games for that genre. Entries are also interspersed with brief essays and comments from designers concerning their games and their ideas about role-playing games in general. The game descriptions are supplemented by a directory of game publishers, a list of award-winning games, definitions of terms, a timeline, and a title index.

Mit Hilfe interdisziplinärer literatur- und spieltheoretischer Methoden wird der Frage nachgegangen, inwiefern sich die unterschiedlichen Aspekte des Rollenspiels voneinander abgrenzen bzw. als Einzelelemente beschreiben lassen. Geboten wird ein Überblick über die Entstehung und Fortentwicklung einer neuen literarischen Gattung im Spannungsfeld zwischen Spielen und Erzählen. Eine Betrachtung unter erzähltheoretischen Gesichtspunkten zeigt, dass Rollenspiele nicht allein Spiele sind, sondern auch ein erzählerisches Potential von hohem Stellenwert besitzen. Von besonderem Interesse ist zudem die Verbindung von Simulation und Narration, die in dieser Form bei keiner anderen literarischen Gattung zu finden ist. Eine vergleichende Untersuchung mehrerer verbreiteter Rollenspiel-Systeme erlaubt Aufschluss über Wesen und Charakter der Gattung sowohl aus narratologischer als auch aus ludologischer Perspektive.},

Some practices of RPG in scholar space don't have an explicit theoretic reference, what allows the appearance of technicism in their discourse and end reproducing the already very criticized teaching system. Some theoretical reference in research about RPG and education go beyond this neopositivist vision of education. The necessity of reflection about the concepts related to education by researchers and professionals that use Roleplaying games is hightlighted.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to make some notes as means of theoretical discussion for educators and researchers about the use of RPG in education. The first part of the theoretical reference of this work presents the history of roleplaying games (RPG) in the U.S. and Brazil and some studies on RPG in the U.S. and Europe. Based on these studies, IT provides a definition of RPG and its five types: table-top RPG, Larp, solo adventure, electronic solo RPG and MMORPG. In the second part of the theoretical reference, the arguments are about the concepts of Vygotsky and his theories in Brazil, some concepts of the Vygotskyan theory, their contributions to education and a reading of the RPG from Vygotsky. The methodology is the concept of state of the art and a possible reading of this concept from Vygotsky for the basis of the procedures of bibliographic survey and analysis of material collected. This was divided into three categories: educational material, books, theses and dissertations. Only those dissertations and theses were selected that have Vygotsky in its theoretical reference. The analyses address the production on RPG in Brazil and the difficulty of access to such production. The aim was to map the concepts of education that permeate the work on RPG in Brazil, in addition to relating some of them to the technicistic pedagogy. It also analyses the material on its use by educators as well as books, dissertations and theses on the assimilation of Vygotskyan theories. There is a need on the part of educators and researchers to take a critical position to address the RPG, and to have clarity in the design of man and society that permeates their practice. It was also discovered that the theories of Vygotsky are little known and exploited.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to probe the effectiveness of a mobile game-based learning approach in modifying behavioural outcomes and competence. The experiment was set against the background of low rates of laymen providing CPR during sudden cardiac arrests. A post-test control group design was used to contrast and evaluate the effects of the two different types of learning. Two hundred two students were randomly assigned to two conditions, a game-based variant simulating an emergency situation (experimental group), and an instruction-based approach (control group). After the intervention participants completed a questionnaire assessing self-prediction, self-efficacy, attitude, subjective norm, empathy and competence. The largest arguably significant difference between the two groups showed in self-prediction and capacity beliefs. Results further revealed a positive relationship between self-prediction and the variables attitude and self-efficacy. The type of scenario did not translate into the other concepts we assessed, though, and results were inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of the type of learning scenario and CPR knowledge. We explain the small effect size partly by the experimental procedure and the design of the game intervention, which is discussed in the course of this article.},

L’antagonisme avec ce dernier terme est tout particulièrement souligné par Henriot dans son ouvrage de 1969 sur le jeu. Or, si toute société s’adosse à une conception du sacré qui lui est spécifique, on doit en déduire que l’extension du ludique dans les sociétés contemporaines implique une transformation radicale du rapport au sacré, et donc une transformation tout aussi radicale du sociale dans son entier. L’article examine de quelle façon l’attitude ludique tente de ré-enchanter un monde moderne qui a perdu son sens, réintroduisant paradoxalement une dimension du sacré qu’elle n’arrête pas de déconstruire.},

  abstract = {Recently Role Playing Games (RPGs), in specific Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D), have sparked in popularity, with mainstream media such as films and series picking up on the phenomenon as well. Particularly during COVID-19 and with the stay-at-home measures, more people have started playing D\&D which has been shown to have a positive effect on their players’ well-being, underscoring the potential mental health benefits of the game. Academics have so far focussed on areas such as how physical customization possibilities of game characters can affect players or how a bond forms between players and characters. However, little attention has been paid to how a character’s personality design and customization options affect the player. This research focuses on how personality design and customization options of the game of D\&D affect the player in terms of character bleed over an extended period through a longitudinal experiment. Character bleed in short is the transfer of aspects of the self into the character (e.g. emotions, behavior, beliefs) and vice versa. A new measurement for character bleed was developed and tested for this purpose. Results show that playing a character close to your own personality leads to more character bleed-in than character bleed-out, and playing a character whose personality you wish to have or playing a character whose personality is opposite to your own equally leads to bleed-in and bleed-out. The results also show that when players play a character that has an opposite personality to their own, there is more bleed-out experienced than when they play a character close to their own personality. Continuing, the study provides helpful insights and further directions for future research, such as further developing and validating the measurement tool for character bleed, with the aim to discover how RPGs like D\&D and character creation can create a healthcare tool to improve one’s wellbeing.},

Worldbuilding is often an integral component of RPGs, whether conducted by designers, players, or both in tandem. Game designers and game masters are worldbuilders by definition, fleshing out a fictional world in code, words, or physical props. In some RPGs, players are inextricably involved in the worldbuilding such that the game only exists once the world is created by its players. In other RPGs, worldbuilding is a top-down process. A designer or group of designers creates the world from high concept to detailed settings and non-player characters. Storylines, plots, and possible sequences of events may be more or less rigidly prescripted. While every game is a co-creation between player and designer, some games are specifically designed to balance their worldbuilding aspects between players and designers.},

Early scholarship on CRPGs often defines them from the perspective of gameplay mechanics. Thus, CRPGs were defined by the existence of elements such as a formal leveling system, randomness, and quantification of characters. CRPGs comprise a seemingly endless variety of subtypes or categories that blend the mechanical elements of CRGPs with those of other video game genres. Perhaps the most significant contribution of CRPGs to role-playing games as a whole is their willingness to experiment with the gaming mechanics that comprise them.},

Lawlor (Philos Phenomenol Res 79(1):47–75, 2009) and Cassam (Vices of the mind: from the intellectual to the political. OUP, Oxford, 2014) develop inferential accounts of self-knowledge in which one can use imagination to acquire self-knowledge. This is done by actively prompting imaginary scenarios and observing one’s reactions to those scenarios. These reactions are then used as the inferential basis for acquiring self-knowledge. I suggest that the imaginary scenarios can be in principle replaced with scenarios in virtual reality in a way that still provides an inferential basis for self-knowledge. Instead of internal prompting in imagination, I call this external prompting in virtual reality. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of external prompting. On one hand, external prompting avoids some of the common biases that can intervene with internal prompting in imagination. On the other hand, external prompting comes with some challenges of its own. External prompting might be more time-consuming and might be open to a game-like approach of the agent leading to a different sort of distortion that gets in the way of self-knowledge. I suggest that these are practical challenges, but nevertheless, external prompting seems worthwhile for self-knowledge that is otherwise especially difficult to acquire.},

Drawing from 43 semi-structured interviews, this article explores board gaming culture from the perspective of women who play modern board games. The findings highlight women’s experiences as a minority and the difficulties they face when entering board games spaces – often perceived as ‘male spaces’ and associated with geek masculinity. The findings also show a ‘gender-gap’ in board games, where women’s reduced levels of experience, awareness and integration into board game culture act as a barrier to their participation and negatively impact their sense of belonging. Despite these barriers, the presence and experience of other women helped to deconstruct the notion that board games were solely for men. Furthermore, the findings also show how men and women are actively constructing newer, more inclusive board games cultures which eschew exclusion and challenge board game’s associations with geek masculinity. This research provides insight into some of the barriers to entry women face as well as the changing nature of contemporary board game culture.},

This paper explores the reported challenges and benefits of playing D\&amp;D through teleconferencing hardware and software, and the experience of using virtual tabletops. A thematic analysis of a sample of Reddit threads discussing player experiences of transitioning D\&amp;D to remote play during COVID-19 social distancing was undertaken. The findings highlight a variety of player attitudes and preferences towards playing D\&amp;D remotely. The data suggest a mostly negative sentiment towards playing D\&amp;D online for groups that had transitioned from in-person to remote play. Loss of in-person socialisation was identified as an important contributor to a poor play experience, but groups would persevere with remote play to maintain social relationships, suggesting that, for many players, D\&amp;D serves an important social function beyond mere play. Some avenues for future research are identified.},

  abstract = {There is a rich body of literature regarding intellectual property’s (“IP”) “negative spaces”—fields where creation and innovation thrive without significant formal protection from IP law. Scholars have written about innovation in diverse fields despite weak or nonexistent IP rights, such as fashion design, fine cuisine, stand-up comedy, magic tricks, tattoos, and sports plays. Instead, these fields rely on social norms, first- mover advantage, and other (non-IP) legal regimes to promote innovation in the absence of IP protection. As a comparison to these studies, this Article comprehensively analyzes the role of IP law in facilitating innovation in tabletop gaming, including board games, card games, and pen-and-paper role-playing games. Over the past several decades, the tabletop gaming industry has seen a proliferation of innovation, but there is surprisingly little in the academic literature about IP and tabletop games. IP rights, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, each protect certain aspects of games, while at the same time being constrained by doctrinal limitations that leave considerable flexibility for others to develop their own games and adapt or improve upon existing ones. There are also numerous examples of user-based innovation in tabletop gaming. This Article concludes by contending that IP rights, as well as their limitations, play a significant role in facilitating the robust innovation presently occurring in the tabletop gaming field.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the role of the reader within the framework of cybertext literature. Emerging in the late 1980s, cybertext literature has reshaped narrative storytelling with the arrival of the technology of links and nodes which opened the way towards video games with a focus on reading and narrative. This shift has blurred the lines between traditional printed literature and digital literature, complicating and revising the way we categorize literary texts. Through the analysis of different types of printed and digital cybertext literary works - namely Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves, Milorad Pavić’s Dictionary of the Khazars, Austin Jorgensen’s Lisa, ZA/UM’s Disco Elysium,  Ice-Pick Lodge’s Pathologic, Obsidian Entertainment’s Fallout: New Vegas, 11 Bit Studios’ This War of Mine and Electronic Arts’ The Sims - this thesis aims to provide insight into the dynamic relationship between cybertexts and their readers and into the way narrative meaning is conveyed through the way the reader is conditioned to traverse the text. Relying on the work of narratologists and cybertext theorists, this paper uses taxonomies of multimodal fiction to illustrate connections between printed and digital works and the distinctions in the way different types of readers and players can be constructed within a participatory narrative framework. Analysis of both printed and digital cybertext literature in this thesis provides insight into the three types of focalising perspectives or three types of cybertext readers - the doubly-deictic reader, the reader-as-protagonist and the omniscient multimodal perspective. As the analysis shows, two of the three focalising perspectives occur both in printed and in digital iterations of cybertext literature, with the third occurring only in digital literature. The final aim of this work is thus to demonstrate ways in which these focalising perspectives function in cybertext literature, as well as to convey the need for further analysis of cybertext readers in order to better understand the overlapping and intersecting categories of reader and player.},

  abstract = {Every project development that could possibly have negative environmental impacts must undergo a technical-administrative procedure called environmental impact assessment (EIA), which ensures that all environmental implications are properly considered before making a decision and that negative impacts are minimized. Therefore, in many universities, technology-oriented master’s degree programs include EIA teaching courses. At the University of Firenze (Italy), one such EIA course module was complemented by a role-playing game in which students acted as typical characters involved in a (simulated) public debate concerning the possible development of a geothermal plant in a rural environment. The roles were designed with competing objectives and contrasting codes of conduct; therefore, the evolution of the debate and the final outcome (acceptance/rejection of the project) were completely in the hands of the players. The game was played with different classes, and the experience was successful. The students reported that the following objectives were reached: (i) they had fun; (ii) they put into practice some theoretical concepts learned during the lessons; (iii) they understood that aspects other than technical ones can be involved in decision processes and dealing with them without proper preparation is very difficult. This last point was considered particularly important, and demonstrated that this role-playing game represented a valuable complement to the main teaching activities.},

These are crafted in support of co-experience values that we argue can inform the design of social wearables. We engaged in a co-design process with a game designer and co-founder of a larp production company, and embedded the resulting social wearables in a larp. Here, we present the results of this design and implementation process, and articulate design affordances that resonate with our larp designer' values.

Overall, this book is a study of various forms and roles that fantasy can take on as part of contemporary Western culture. The study suggests that fantasy emerges as a different type of interpretation of normalised performance and reality, and can thus provide individuals with the tools to wield agency in everyday life.

TRPGs offer an interactive and structured platform for participants to engage in scenario-based simulations, problem-solving activities, and decision-making exercises. Through immersive experiences, TRPGs enable participants to gain insights into the challenges, constraints, and dynamics of the creative industry. The study presents the application of TRPGs in a workshop called “Agents of Equality and Empowerment”, involving professionals, freelancers, students, academics, and NGO workers from the creative sectors. By assuming the roles of women creatives in TRPG scenarios, participants investigatedissues like brain drain, motherhood, childcare, networking, connections, pay gap, and lack of role models. The workshop aimed to identify necessary changes, understand priorities, and explore the subjective experiences of women creatives in the North East. Findings derived from surveys, qualitative analysis of in-game interactions, observations, and reflections shed light on practical aspects and emotional dimensions of women's involvement in the creative industries. This understanding facilitates a deeper exploration of barriers, biases, societal expectations, and cultural influences that shape their professional journeys.},

The tool is explored from an archetypal orientation and its applicability for other theoretical orientations was also considered. An artistic-creative approach is employed and responses from five adult participants were analyzed for themes. TTRI combines group work, play therapy, and therapeutic role-play under one intervention, using the imaginal realm to explore the participants' experiences. Analysis of participant responses suggests that TTRI is functional and useful with therapeutic groups. The results also indicate that TTRI may allow for the exploration of conscious and unconscious factors of behaviors and thought process.},

  abstract = {Tabletop roleplaying games are experiencing a resurgence in popularity and have been used in pragmatics therapy and for social-emotional learning. However, little research exists to describe how players of a game construct and uphold pragmatic norms during gameplay. Using a synthesis of conversation analysis and frame analysis techniques, this study seeks to understand how one group of professional gamers navigates conversational turn-taking during gameplay. 1.5 hours of gameplay conversation was transcribed using Jeffersonian transcription, and twelve selected segments of the transcript were analyzed based on framing, use of character voices, and overlapping talk. Results indicate that turn-taking is weakly affected by use of character voice and performance, as well as affected by strong emotions and the narrative significance of each utterance. Individual tendencies regarding overlapping talk are not uniform across a group but are not necessarily punished for not conforming to an overall norm. This study stands as a unique example of how conversation analysis and frame analysis can be used in conjunction to analyze the conversational norm-building of a social group.},

The results show a wide variety of ways that audience interactions profoundly impact the game’s narrative and the type of role they play in the creation of the story.

  abstract = {This dissertation examines the identity implications of table-top role-playing fantasy games. Based on nineteen months of participant-observation of a gaming group, twenty in-depth interviews, and archival data from email lists and websites, I show gamers used gaming to construct a moral identity, court self-testing risks, and explore possible selves. Gamers created the moral identity "good gamer" through display of six qualities: dedication, cooperation, selflessness, creativity, intelligence, and authenticity. By displaying these qualities, gamers constructed themselves not only as good gamers, but as good people. Gamers courted self-testing risks by engaging in "edgework without the edge." This involved gamers testing the limits of fantasy characters' abilities and putting those characters' lives, rather than their own, at risk. Gamers also engaged in fictive heroism, creating characters who were slightly better versions of themselves. By putting these characters through adventures and ordeals in a fictional game world, gamers explored alternative moralities and possible selves. My research shows how activities that are largely based on imagination and might be seen by many as frivolous can have serious real-world consequences. Future research might thus fruitfully examine how other activities that occur in virtual or imaginary worlds come to shape real-world identities and self-conceptions.},

Edgework, as defined by Stephen Lyng, occurs when people voluntarily tread boundaries to gain emotional rewards. Based on nineteen months of participant-observation in a gaming group, twenty in-depth interviews, and archival data from e-mail lists and websites, I show how gamers gained many of the benefits that traditional edgeworkers, like extreme sports participants, obtain without the physical danger. Participants tread the boundaries of sanity/insanity and order/disorder, prepared for their edgework, and sustained an illusion of control. By playing a game, they felt alive and powerful, yet removed the edge, thus engaging in “virtual edgework.” In contrast to previous studies, I show that what makes an activity edgework is not the type of risk but how the experience is structured. I suggest that future scholars need to consider new avenues for edgework as people’s lives move online.},

As more states and nations require computational thinking skills in P-12 education, connections between games and problem solving, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and abstraction become visible. Players demonstrate these problem-solving skills when considering the probability of success with certain moves, character placement to minimize damage, or fine-tuning resources to maximize gains. The variation in complexity, type, genre, time requirements, player interactions, and so forth helps make games so popular. Individuals can locate the exemplars that match their interests.},

We hypothesize that a multi-task model that trains on character dialogue plus character relationship information improves transformer-based story continuation. To this end, we extend the Critical Role Dungeons and Dragons Dataset (Rameshkumar and Bailey, 2020) -- consisting of dialogue transcripts of people collaboratively telling a story while playing the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons -- with automatically extracted relationships between each pair of interacting characters as well as their personas. A series of ablations lend evidence to our hypothesis, showing that our multi-task model using character relationships improves story continuation accuracy over strong baselines.},

Findings – Many options are available to libraries wishing to provide support for fantasy role-playing game programming. While an overwhelming quantity of publications are often available for purchase, usually only a bare minimum is required to run a role-playing game. Free or modestly priced options are available for libraries on a shoestring budget. Libraries interested in supporting fantasy role-playing game programming with collections need not spend much. Spending less on collections requires a greater amount of imagination, socializing, creativity, collaboration and literacy on the part of program participants. Originality/value – Many libraries are interested in supporting fantasy role-playing games with collections, but do not know where to start. While much is being written about gaming in libraries, little has been written to help libraries navigate current role-playing game book publication and sales models.},

  abstract = {One of the growing phenomena of our digital age is the proliferation of digital fan spaces (Gee, 2018). Dedicated to a specific fandom or activity, these spaces have allowed participants to play competitively, share videos with each other, create fanfiction, provide feedback to one another and engage in a host of literacies around something they share an affinity for (Black, 2009; Gee, 2017a). Through advances in technology, access to multiple tools and highly specialized knowledge of specific subjects, youth can now create communities in online spaces where they can engage in complex activities with their friends and fellow gamers without the presence of external moderation. As this social phenomenon has grown, so has the research around it in educational spaces. Some scholars now increasingly conduct educational research beyond what is “focused upon learning as instantiated in social institutions,” (Hayes \& Duncan, 2012, p. 10), or more specifically, schools. The argument presented is that schools, while an important part of learning, account for just a fraction of youths’ time spent and do not account for many of the literacies and social practices they engage in when involved in these self-selected spaces. This study explores various literacy and social practices of youth in an online gaming environment. The purpose is to better understand how youth engage in literacy and social practices within spaces they themselves create and moderate in pursuit of their own interests.},

  abstract = {Background Research into transgressive play experiences in games has grown in recent years. In this article, we explore the potential for transgressive play to be constructive in multiplayer settings—something we conceptualize as “benevolent transgression.” Aim This article describes the presence and appeal of benevolent transgressive play experiences in the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons [D\&D]. Research Methods In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted focus group discussions (3 groups, 14 participants, aged 24–55) and an online survey (354 participants, aged 18–63) with current D\&D players to better understand what play experiences were meaningful and appealing for them—in consideration of the game’s contemporary resurgence. Key Finding and Discussion Our qualitative analysis focuses on participant responses that described the presence and appeal of transgressive play that knowingly challenges player boundaries or game boundaries, what we term benevolent transgression. We propose two key factors that we believe enable it—1) player agency and 2) collaborative negotiation—and briefly discuss benevolent transgression in consideration of game-based learning [GBL].},

Though the game’s resurgence has been widely discussed in non-academic outlets, it has been neglected in academic literature. While there are many factors motivating renewed and engaged play of D\&D, in this paper we draw on our 2019 study of contemporary D\&D players to present key contextual factors of the game’s resurgence. Through discussion of our results, we argue that the influence of representations and trends in popular media, reduction of associated stigma, and impact of convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006) on increased game access, have led to the resurgence of D\&D according to our participants and shed light on some key reasons for its success in recent years.},

  abstract = {On the fiftieth anniversary of Dungeons \& Dragons, a collection of essays that explores and celebrates the game's legacy and its tremendous impact on gaming and popular culture. In 2024, the enormously influential tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons—also known as D\&D—celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. To mark the occasion, editors Premeet Sidhu, Marcus Carter, and José Zagal have assembled an edited collection that celebrates and reflects on important parts of the game's past, present, and future. Each chapter in Fifty Years of Dungeons \& Dragons explores why the nondigital game is more popular than ever—with sales increasing 33 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite worldwide lockdowns—and offers readers the opportunity to critically reflect on their own experiences, perceptions, and play of D\&D. Fifty Years of Dungeons \& Dragons draws on fascinating research and insight from expert scholars in the field, including: Gary Alan Fine, whose 1983 book Shared Fantasy remains a canonical text in game studies; Jon Peterson, celebrated D\&D historian; Daniel Justice, Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Literature and Expressive Culture; and numerous leading and emerging scholars from the growing discipline of game studies, including Amanda Cote, Esther MacCallum-Stewart, and Aaron Trammell. The chapters cover a diverse range of topics—from D\&D's adoption in local contexts and classrooms and by queer communities to speculative interpretations of what D\&D might look like in one hundred years—that aim to deepen readers' understanding of the game.},

Here, we focus on responses to the open-ended survey question: “What has been your most memorable moment in a D\&D game? Please describe an example from your own play.” Common themes in responses were connected to three key elements of D\&D’s design: gameplay, role-play, and storytelling. We subsequently identify 1) the importance of D\&D’s “critical” dice-roll mechanic, 2) how D\&D enables memorable role-play, and 3) the enduring appeal of heroic stories. By emphasizing how elements of D\&D’s design can impact players’ experiences and enjoyment of the game, this paper offers new insights into the appeal of D\&D which go beyond simplistic descriptions of the game being ‘fun’ or ‘social’.},

  abstract = {In game studies, meaningful play is commonly discussed and situated through Salen and Zimmerman’s (2004) definition describing it as the integrated and discernible relationship between player actions and system outcomes within the context of the game. However, this overlooks other ways that play can be meaningful. Based on observation and interviews with 20 Australian players, this article examines experiences with death in the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D). In the context of meaningful play (Salen \& Zimmerman, 2004) and positive negative experiences (Hopeametsä, 2008), we discuss (1) the impact of shared physical and social realities on death in D\&D, (2) the design of death in D\&D, and (3) how death in D\&D shapes the future play and lives of players. From this, we argue that play can have meaning that transcends game boundaries, subsequently proposing the concept of “pivotal play” to describe appealing, memorable, and transformative play experiences.},

Despite their growing popularity in recent years, investigation of non-digital games and learning remains limited in comparison. This paper describes the game design process and presents a key finding from early playtest data of All Players Are Equal—a Dungeons \& Dragons [D\&D] (Arneson and Gygax 1974) one-shot experience inspired by George Orwell’s novel Animal Farm (1945). The game leverages mechanics such as agency, transgression, and death—which are also key themes represented in the novel—to facilitate a shared pivotal play and learning experience. By discussing key design choices and reflections from initial playtests (12 participants total, 7M, 5F, aged 1840), this paper offers insight into how opportunities for pivotal play and learning may be created or enhanced within games.},

  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to explore how the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons [D\&D] cultivates rich learning experiences. To achieve the aim, this thesis seeks to understand: 1) the appeal of D\&D, 2) where and how learning occurs within D\&D, and 3) whether learning can be designed into D\&D. I accomplish this through three qualitative research studies. Study 1 investigates factors contributing to D\&D’s contemporary appeal. Data collected from interviews and gameplay observations informs my conceptualisation of pivotal play which describes memorable, appealing, and transformative gameplay experiences that view meaningful play from a learning lens. Study 2 further explores D\&D’s contemporary appeal, directing attention towards learning experiences. Data collected from online focus groups and an online survey informs my proposal of benevolent transgression which describes constructive social play that knowingly challenges player boundaries or game boundaries. Study 3 applies the insights from my two previous studies to the design of an original D\&D one-shot (i.e., a short one-off gameplay experience) intended to facilitate learning through pivotal play and benevolent transgression. Data collected from my game design prototyping and playtesting process indicates that the one-shot format and opportunities for explicit reflection are an engaging way to encourage rich learning through gameplay. Ultimately, by proposing two new concepts that expand existing understandings of games and learning —pivotal play and benevolent transgression—and designing a one-off gameplay experience incorporating these insights, this thesis generates and contributes original knowledge on how D\&D is able to cultivate rich learning experiences through meaningful gameplay moments. It demonstrates the possibilities of games and their learning affordances and encourages repositioning enshrined assumptions and theories related to the field of games and learning.},

Second, this chapter addresses how players negotiate with these “urtexts” in carving out queer potentials. Drawing from numerous examples, the authors conclude that the emergence of queer play necessitates the affordances of the urtext of the game, each player’s unique approach to play, and the core player group or online community in which the play is situated.},

  abstract = {H.P. Lovecraft's short-story “The Call of Cthulhu”, published in 1928 in an issue of Weird Tales, was paramount for the evolution of what is known today as Science Fiction. By means of applying Gothic fiction tropes in his narratives, together with cosmic entities from outer space, Lovecraft is undoubtedly a pioneer in the xenofiction genre. Despite his unsuccessful career as a writer, both setting and lore surrounding Lovecratf's oeuvre eventually became popular in the late twentieth century, originating other works of fiction, as well as games, following the same style. The concept of role-playing game has its roots in the 1930s popular parlor game Jury Box. However, it was only in 1974, after Dungeons \& Dragons was published, that the concept became widespread. Like any other games, from the simplest to the most complex, role-playing games have rules that define the conditions of victory or defeat. However, there are certain peculiarities which make role-playing games different from conventional video games. These aspects are in fact elements which are intrinsically related to theatrics and dramatic expression, namely the narrator and the actor. This paper will examine the relationship between the concept of game and theatrics as well as the role of performative acts in this relationship. As such, Call of Cthulhu (1981), a tabletop role-playing game based on lovecraftian fictional lore and myths, will be used to counter Roger Caillois's statement in Man, Play and Games (1961) that 'A characteristic of play, in fact, is that it creates no wealth or goods, thus differing from work or art.' (Caillois 2001: 5). In order to do this, it will be demonstrated that, despite being a game, tabletop role-playing games in general, with particular emphasis on Call of Cthulhu, actually do create something of literary value.},

One such product is a custom miniature; players use these to track their character’s location and for the enjoyment of creating a physical representation of their imagination. Virtual Tabletops (VTT’s) were developed to make the entire experience digital. The digital nature of VTT’s make all of the game’s rules and mechanics accessible at the click of the mouse; however, it also alienates players from a physical connection to the game. The smart game board offers digital convenience while preserving the physical connection to the game. The game board wirelessly communicates with the pieces on the board to provide quick access to their specific rules and mechanics while also determining their location on the board. The board utilizes a digital display to swap between different game boards/maps. The smart game board saves time and simplifies the experience for players by displaying only the most relevant information and it enhances their experience by utilizing their custom miniatures. This makes the game more accessible to beginners, reduces risk of error for the game master and allows everyone to focus more on enjoying the game. This product could easily be adapted to accommodate any board game with pieces large enough to contain wireless communication technology. Future developments of this product could also include an automatic board setup feature if the piece has a known board layout such as chess, checkers, or monopoly.},

The book is intended for LARP participants, academics interested in play or in collaborative development, those interested in new uses of familiar learning environments, and game developers with an interest in creating games with highly interactive narratives and co-creative play experiences in which the role of designer and player is blurred."--Back cover.},

  abstract = {This work is the product of a six-year ethnographic study of a live-action role playing (LARP) community organized around the Intercon theater-style LARP convention. The work explores LARP as a practice, formed by this community. Though the practice evolves over time, this work shows some of the common structures evident in LARP practice considered good by the Intercon LARP community. The analysis of this ethnographic work shows commonalities with other forms of role play, including the history of social simulations used in formal and informal learning environments, theater, reenactment communities, and various role playing games. In addition to description and historical context, this work explores some of the structures evident in this community's LARP practice that set this practice apart as a significant form of participant production and collaborative storytelling. The work explores some of the constraints and affordances of designing, and co-designing, within this highly collaborative environment in ways that facilitate engagement with a variety of LARP participants. This exploration identifies the structure of LARP, in the abstract, as a combination of character, world, and theme, each of which are composed of story, environment, rules, and play. In this structure, play has an operational role in instantiating the other elements within LARP, turning written material, costuming, set design, and other forms of preparatory activity into reality through performance. Finally, this work explores the potential for LARP use as a tool for developing empathy, critical ethical reasoning, and various forms of content learning and technical competencies.},

Nous analyserons les jeux comme des plans d'architectes orientant la construction même des oeuvres.    Dans la continuité du master, ceci sera divisé en deux volets d'environ 200 pages chacun : l'un théorique, l'autre créatif, ce dernier étant un roman que j'appelle "Hauteurs Contemporaines".     Ce roman raconte l'histoire d'une dramaturge mourante qui organise une partie d'échecs en grandeur nature dans son hôtel, chaque pièce de l'hôtel correspondant à une case de l'échiquier. La partie oppose sa famille à sa troupe et permettra de déterminer lesquels d'entre eux hériteront de la lourde tâche d'achever et de mettre en scène ses oeuvres autobiographiques.},

  abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sequence classification Natural Language Processing task where entities are identified in the text and classified into predefined categories. It acts as a foundation for most information extraction systems. Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) is an open-ended tabletop fantasy game with its own diverse lore. DnD entities are domain-specific and are thus unrecognizable by even the state-of-the-art off-the-shelf NER systems as the NER systems are trained on general data for pre-defined categories such as: person (PERS), location (LOC), organization (ORG), and miscellaneous (MISC). For meaningful extraction of information from fantasy text, the entities need to be classified into domain-specific entity categories as well as the models be fine-tuned on a domain-relevant corpus. This work uses available lore of monsters in the D\&D domain to fine-tune Trankit, which is a prolific NER framework that uses a pre-trained model for NER. Upon this training, the system acquires the ability to extract monster names from relevant domain documents under a novel NER tag. This work compares the accuracy of the monster name identification against; the zero-shot Trankit model and two FLAIR models. The fine-tuned Trankit model achieves an 87.86\% F1 score surpassing all the other considered models.},

Existing literature on therapeutic modalities with similar methods and theories of change suggest TTRPGs holds great promise in creating positive change for certain mental health populations, particularly those that have not responded well to traditional psychotherapy formats. At this time, no published, peer-reviewed research has examined TTRPG therapy groups offered to adults. Here we describe the application of one 8-week TTRPG therapy group with seven adults at a forensic facility. In this case study, we also describe the data we gathered and our findings regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefits of participating in this TTRPG. Our findings provide preliminary support of the feasibility and acceptability of this approach, and offer new directions on how to maximize benefits to group members.

It specifically explores the differences between, and sustainability of, mental~models constructed within three various educational environments: (1) a digital~game played on PCs, (2) a non-digital role-playing game, and (3) a traditional~lecture with discussions. We conducted a laboratory experiment, in which~participants (253 high school students, M = 112, F = 141, mean age 16.5) studied~EU laws, institutions, and politics in the three above-mentioned environments. We~evaluated and compared mental models participants constructed through content~analysis of the concept maps they drew immediately after the experiment and others~made one month later. Within the analysis, we studied content, architecture, and~changes in mental models over time. The resulting data offer unique insight into~the process of mental models creation and sustainability thereof within game-based~learning; particularly, when using a digital game. Digital game-based learners’~concept maps differed in comparison with those of the educational role-playing and~traditional lecture groups; the students tended to keep less altered mental models in their long-term memory: even after the one month period. The results suggest that a digital game-based learning environment could be more successful in mental model retention and for efficacy of future recall; particularly, when dealing with complex phenomena like EU law.},

  abstract = {Self-efficacy (SE), the theoretical basis for the study, is the internal belief that one is capable of appropriately addressing a given situation. High SE is linked to positive outcomes in diverse areas such as academics, health, and career. Therapeutic role play has been found to increase SE through mastery experiences, yet the correlation between roleplaying games (RPGs) and general and social SE has remained unexamined. In this study, the SE of gamers was examined for a statistically significant correlation between roleplaying activities and SE over that of the general, nonroleplaying population. A convenience sample of 414 adult gamers completed the General Self-efficacy Exam (GSE), Perceived Social Self-Efficacy scale (PSSE), and surveys of RPG activity and demographics. Findings showed a correlation between participation in RPGs and general SE [t(413) = 24.90, p {$<$}. 001], though not between RPGs and social SE. There was no overall correlation between time and general SE, though time was positively correlated with social SE (r = .083, p {$<$} .05). An ANOVA found that GMs have higher levels of both general [F(2, 411) = 30.92, p {$<$} .001] and social [F(2, 411) = 8.978, p {$<$} .001] SE than among individuals who were primarily players or who were equally players and GMs. The multidimensional importance of high SE throughout the life experience makes it vital to identify many avenues for improving SE. Knowledge of the correlation between RPGs and SE is an important contribution to existing literature, opening up the possibility of establishing a causal link between RPGs and SE through experimentation. Findings could enhance social change initiatives through identification of an inexpensive, easily-accessible, and enjoyable method for increasing SE across the lifespan.},

It is especially interested in the role of the player in a TRPG, which allows consumers of Shakespearean adaptations to embody the many roles of the player, actor, director, and playwright. As such, TRPGs and the role of the player allow for a unique form of narrative agency and engagement with Shakespeare unavailable in other mediums. This unique form of narrative agency, in addition to aspects of early modern theatrical practice like cross-dressing and single-sex casts, are brought together to examine the recuperative potential Shakespearean TRPGs offer transgender and queer players wishing to speak back to Shakespeare or establish a more positive presence in his – and our – world.},

The archaic techniques of promoting spiritual ecstasy, which remain central to religious healing traditions around the world, now also have contemporary analogues in virtual worlds found on the internet. In this innovative book, Jeffrey G. Snodgrass argues that avatars allow for the ecstatic projection of consciousness into alternate realities, potentially providing both the spiritually possessed and gamers access to superior secondary identities with elevated social standing. Even if only temporary, self-transformations of these kinds can help reduce psychosocial stress and positively impact health and well-being.},

  abstract = {In their classic accounts, anthropological ethnographers developed causal arguments for how specific sociocultural structures and processes shaped human thought, behavior, and experience in particular settings. Despite this history, many contemporary ethnographers avoid establishing in their work direct causal relationships between key variables in the way that, for example, quantitative research relying on experimental or longitudinal data might. As a result, ethnographers in anthropology and other fields have not advanced understandings of how to derive causal explanations from their data, which contrasts with a vibrant “causal revolution” unfolding in the broader social and behavioral sciences. Given this gap in understanding, we aim in the current article to clarify the potential ethnography has for illuminating causal processes related to the cultural influence on human knowledge and practice. We do so by drawing on our ongoing mixed methods ethnographic study of games, play, and avatar identities. In our ethnographic illustrations, we clarify points often left unsaid in both classic anthropological ethnographies and in more contemporary interdisciplinary theorizing on qualitative research methodologies. More specifically, we argue that for ethnographic studies to illuminate causal processes, it is helpful, first, to state the implicit strengths and logic of ethnography and, second, to connect ethnographic practice more fully to now well-developed interdisciplinary approaches to causal inference. In relation to the first point, we highlight the abductive inferential logic of ethnography. Regarding the second point, we connect the ethnographic logic of abduction to what Judea Pearl has called the ladder of causality, where moving from association to intervention to what he calls counterfactual reasoning produces stronger evidence for causal processes. Further, we show how graphical modeling approaches to causal explanation can help ethnographers clarify their thinking. Overall, we offer an alternative vision of ethnography, which contrasts, but nevertheless remains consistent with, currently more dominant interpretive approaches.},

Technologists have developed tools to detect deepfakes, but these tools can sometimes yield inaccurate results, raising concerns about inadvertently disseminating manipulated content as authentic news. This study examines the impact of unreliable deepfake detection tools on information verifcation. We conducted role-playing exercises with 24 US journalists, immersing them in complex breaking-news scenarios where determining authenticity was challenging. Through these exercises, we explored questions regarding journalists’ investigative processes, use of a deepfake detection tool, and decisions on when and what to publish. Our fndings reveal that journalists are diligent in verifying information, but sometimes rely too heavily on results from deepfake detection tools. We argue for more cautious release of such tools, accompanied by proper training for users to mitigate the risk of unintentionally propagating manipulated content as real news.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are “a collaborative narrative game where group members role-play a character that they create in order to solve puzzles, uncover treasure, and defeat monsters in a fictional environment that is created together using formal rules and participation structures'’ (Davis \& Kilmer, 2020). TTRPGs have begun to increase in popularity and evoke new interest in exploring whether these new treatment modalities result in positive mental health outcomes. Specifically, therapeutically applied role-playing games (TARPGs) are TTRPGs that integrate therapeutic mechanisms in order to promote improved psychological and social functioning. The goal of the present study was to examine and understand the outcomes of TARPGs for psychological and social functioning in youth/young adult populations utilizing participant and parent data. Data was collected as part of quality improvement procedures from a nonprofit organization and were obtained for the purpose of the present study. Results revealed small decreases on measures of empathy (d = 0.43) and self-esteem (d = 0.24) for youth. Evaluation of parents indicated that no changes were observed on the measured scores. Results from the present study, while limited, still yielded important implications for the utility of TARPGs for youth/young adult populations. Future research should continue to expand the limited research on TARPGs as a clinical intervention to determine the efficacy of TARPGs as an evidence supported intervention.},

Our methodology involves integrating game-specific controls through functions, which we show improves the narrative quality and state update consistency of the AI game master. The experimental results, based on human evaluations and unit tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing gameplay experience and maintaining coherence with the game state.

  abstract = {The hobby of Tabletop Role-Playing Games has grown significantly in the last five years, with the most well-known game of the genre, Dungeons \& Dragons (DnD), receiving widespread attention. As a game that integrates highly performative elements into its gameplay, DnD is uniquely able to harness play as a means of facilitating players to engage with performance. This thesis is focused on investigating this phenomenon and theorizing on ways to harness it. Through interviews with six TTRPG players, four main aspects of play in DnD were found: Role-play, Social Interaction, Freedom of Expression, and Storytelling. These are the four main “fun factors” of DnD. Each of these aspects were cross-examined through a performance studies lens as well other disciplinary tools such as the MDA framework, a system for analyzing game design by identifying Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics present in games. Through this process, an experimental game session of DnD was created and play tested by interviewees. Based on findings from interviews and the experimental game session, this thesis concludes that DnD’s primary strength is the creation of a “game-space” for players, a form of protected space in which players are free from external pressures or fears. This space is created by the four fun factors, supported by the framework of a systemized set of rules, and creates a suspension of players’ usual perception of performance, allowing players to engage in performance activities without as much apprehension.},

  abstract = {The process of worldbuilding in games often forgoes the aspect of connecting the setting with the game’s mechanics. Skipping this vital process often leaves games with beautiful, but ultimately empty and meaningless worlds, and abstract, disconnected mechanics. The objective of this thesis was to study and present ways to intertwine the mechanics and the story of a game. The thesis studied several methods of worldbuilding to create a step-by-step process of worldbuilding, and used the set approach to construct a fictional fantasy world as a campaign setting for Dungeons \& Dragons roleplaying game, building each part with applying the same rules in layers. This fantasy world was then used as a basis for an adventure module, built using similar process. The aim of the process was to build a game world that would link the story aspects of the world with the mechanics of the game as tightly as possible. The end result product of the thesis was Working Title: Dream Stone, an adventure module for 5th edition Dungeons \& Dragons. The adventure takes place in a fictional world created using the process detailed in this thesis. However, more time and resources would have been needed to complete the worldbuilding process in its entirety, as well as to refine the product. Additionally, more playtesting would have been required to gain full understanding of the functionality of the adventure. Despite this, the final product managed to produce valuable information regarding the processes of worldbuilding in games.},

  abstract = {In Cruel Optimism, Lauren Berlant asserts that “fantasy [can serve] as a life-sustaining defense against the attritions of ordinary violent history,” which is a statement that holds true for many queer role-players in TTRPG spaces (Berlant 2012, 45). Around the table, these worlds enable players to discover and render their identities legible in social utopian spaces and rehearse their performance for life outside of them. Through engaging with scholarship, autoethnographic writing, and cultural production surrounding TTRPGs, queer identity, avatars, and gender performance, this project asserts that TTRPGs function as safe spaces for becoming, due in part to the ability to create an avatar, or “flexible representational stand-in” for the self, that is queer and embodied through role-play (McMillan, 2015 13). This is achieved through tracking the author’s experience of discovering and forming their queer and trans identity through role-playing various characters and disciplining their function through related interdisciplinary theory across queer, feminist, and role-playing studies. Additionally, through utilizing additional ethnographic accounts and analyzing TTRPG-based media in theatre and actual play spaces, this project further establishes how the emancipatory potential in escapist TTRPG fantasy spaces can ultimately alter queer role-players’ engagement with material reality in a world adversarial to their existence and visibility, especially in light of the past few years.},

  abstract = {The school should be the place of excellence to learn. However, learning means much more than acquiring specific content in academic subjects. Assuming that the training in the school should be based on the autonomy and flexibility of the curriculum, and that meaningful learning requires several literacies [1], multiple theoretical and practical skills, promotion of scientific knowledge, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, creativity and collaborative work and the 21st century skills are feasible through game-based learning [2] or playful literacy [3]. So, this article reports on a role-play game experience aimed at these competencies and specially to interpersonal relationships and self-concept. The experience was presented, following a request for a psychoeducational intervention in a school group with complaints of behavior, challenge to authority, breach of norms and lack of cordial conduct, attitudes of conflict, with great heterogeneity of ages, socio-cultural provenance and suspicious situations of (pre) bullying among students. The experience consisted on the interpretation of characters in a role-play table-top game (RPG) inspired by Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D or DnD) [4]. The characters move themselves in a fantasy adventure while actively constructing a story, in an open world of possibilities where each participant decides within the limits of the reasonability allowed by the others and the contexts presented by the narrator, or D-Master (DM). The narrator organizes the game, creates the details describing to the players what they see and hear, presents the challenges, maintaining a realistic continuity of events while controlling the development of the adventure, except in the actions of the characters. Everyone play and take own decisions to solve the problems faced and described by the DM. The decisions are discussed and a consensus must arise or is determined by the narrator's orientations in accordance with the fate and consequences of rolling the dice. Playing the game suppose immersion in the scenarios presented, acceptance of the challenge and a state of flow or focus shifted from the real world to the game world, social interaction and affect generated. So, by participating in the game, the 24 students of the 7th grade participating were encouraged to put into practice values and competencies identified to be essential to develop themselves as individuals and members of a group. After a period of 5 sessions, the individual experiences were assessed in terms of flow, self-competence, affection towards the others using de Game User Questionnaire [5]. All the participants expressed pleasure in participating and availability to continue the experience, noting their improved ability to regulate the mood and social behaviour. They also revealed interest in deepening different themes, that means, availability to learn. The students, teachers as well as the observers concluded that the approach was pertinent and should go on within the school context to promote competencies.},

  abstract = {In 2020–2021, under the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, boardgame players around the world sought out ways to play physical boardgames with each other despite being physically apart. Their creative appropriations of digital technologies and physical tools to allow for hybrid distanced play demonstrate not only the resilience of boardgaming as a hobby, but also provide important insights into the design of novel distanced hybrid digital boardgames (DHDBs). Through a survey of over 1300 respondents, this paper explores the ways distanced players engaged in homebrew practices to make physical boardgame play possible. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identify three themes that reflect the practical issues players grappled with, including game choice, game mode or setup, and technical implementation. Reflecting on the challenges and opportunities associated with these issues, we consider their implications for DHDB design more generally. In doing so, we present the DHYE (Distanced Hybrid plaY Experience) framework, a practical set of design considerations that emphasises an understanding of distance not simply as an obstacle to enjoyable boardgame play but as an inspiration for novel and meaningful design.},

Good vs neutral vs evil is fairly self-explanatory, but lawful vs neutral vs chaotic may be less so. D\&amp;D characters with a lawful mentality believe that compliance with rules is itself the principal goal and that any deviation from rules is intrinsically wrong. In contrast, characters of a chaotic bent intrinsically believe all rules are wrong, period, and that they should be able to do whatever feels right. Those with a neutral alignment live in the middle. They have no intrinsic aversion to rules but believe that it is the spirit of the law that counts and that deviations from rigid adherence to rules make sense in some cases.},

  abstract = {In Technologies of the Self (1988), philosopher and sociologist Michel Foucault summarizes his life work as an analysis of how various truth games explore “the relationships between truth, power, and self” and in this series of lectures he investigates the “practices whereby individuals, by their own means or with the help of others, acted on their own bodies, souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being in order to transform themselves to attain a certain state of perfection or happiness” (Foucault 1988, 15, 18). While Foucault provides a genealogy of religious and philosophical examples of these technologies of the self, those familiar with role-playing games (RPGs) recognize that their practice also meets these criteria. Even though most people play RPGs for entertainment and escapism, they are potentially transformative (Kemper 2020; Bowman and Hugaas 2021), especially erotic-horror RPGs, like Vampire: The Masquerade (VtM) (Davis et al. 1992).This essay will explain how RPGs function as a type of truth game and how they can be understood as technologies of the self when played to achieve transformative bleed. It will also use Foucault’s thought to explain how some RPGs, like VtM, are better suited for transformative bleed because their technology of signs, i.e., the setting and rules that define meaning within the game, enable the development of more psychologically complex characters through game mechanics inspired by Jungian depth psychology (Bowman 2010; Beltrán 2012, 2013). Finally, my most recent character, Robin Alecto, Robin Alecto, will be used as a case study of how the game mechanics of VtM function as a technology of the self.},

Eighty-five people ages 18-25 were surveyed on their perceived levels of these three variables, as well as how often they played TTRPGs. Responses of those who did play TTRPGs were compared with results of those who did not play TTRPGs. A statistically significant positive correlation was identified in all participants between creativity and self-efficacy, creativity and social skills, and self-efficacy and social skills. Participants who played TTRPGs scored statistically significantly higher in measures of creativity than participants who did not play TTRPGs. There was no statistically significant difference in the two groups in terms of self-efficacy or social skills. These findings, along with previous studies concentrating on possible benefits of TTRPGs, suggest that there is a strong relationship between creativity and playing TTRPGs, and further investigation into ways TTRPGs could be implemented in the treatment of autistic patients are warranted.},

During this game, the students had the opportunity to act as different stakeholders. In order to assess the impact of this game on participants’ thoughts of who might be affected by a flood event, two questionnaires were used, one before and one after the game. The results show that there was very positive feedback from the participants on how this RPG helped them realize the different implications a flood event might have on citizens and decision makers. The community-based aspect that was chosen for this RPG implementation showed the difficulties the specific roles would face as single individuals and as a community in general. Using a similar approach can help any stakeholder understand the challenges in a more direct way than with traditional lecturing and presentations.},

  abstract = {This thesis project consists of a conversation-analytic approach to performed affect, frame navigation, and creative language use in a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) context. Drawing on work in the domains of narrative processing, embodiment, affective production and perception, intertextuality, and the boundaries of play, this research investigates the role of language use in facilitating playful interaction and affect. TTRPG sessions are entertaining, playful experiences aimed at collaborative narrative building through the use of synthetic characters in a fictional world. Players speak as their characters, acting out their desires, motivations, and actions. The goal of TTRPG play is the collaborative construction of a narrative, and work in Discourse Studies has established that emotional narratives are more compelling and impactful than their non-emotional counterparts, generating identification and involvement from audience members with story world characters. TTRPG players, however, are in the unique position of both audience and creator, since their response to story world stimuli has the capacity to influence events in the narrative being constructed. Work in games scholarship illustrates that in emotional story world circumstances of conflict, loss, resolution, and levity, players employ affective cues to represent their characters’ emotions, even if it ’bleeds’ into a strong emotional response that has potential negative repercussions for the player. This research attempts to address the question of why players perform this affect, examining ten excerpts of play from Critical Role, an actual play Dungeons \& Dragons show, that immediately follow or concern emotional story world circumstances and analyzing them for affective cues, their appraisal and affirmation, navigation across the game-reality boundary, and players’ capacity for creative language use. Ultimately, this work aims to contribute to the broader question of why we play narrative games and what we get out of them, through its analysis of the role played by language in facilitating creative interaction.},

We discuss how PC death affects gameplay by breaking up time, by ending or starting a period of play, or by reinforcing or severing player and PC connections. The objective of this analysis is to improve our understanding of PC death, as well as PC life and the control, agency and play associated with it.},

Each of these games comes from companies or series with a history of enforcing binary gender. Making such shifts to include both gender equity and same-sex romance sparked backlash, particularly at a moment when “woke” cultural production is under intense cultural scrutiny. By examining the responses to these three very different, but culturally significant, games, we contextualize the importance of meaningful gender and sexuality inclusivity in gaming given a history of reactionary movements in gaming culture (most notoriously Gamergate). Critically, all of these games became bestsellers, suggesting that while “go woke, go broke” might remain a rallying cry in small portions of gaming subculture, the move towards inclusivity is ultimately not harming the commercial success of these games.},

Using the "hag" inDungeons \& Dragonsas a case study, the authors demonstrate how the game's bestiary, theMonster Manual, functions as a tool of patriarchal control by defining, categorizing, and classifying the body of the female other as evil, abject, and monstrous. Importantly, the ludic bestiary not only exists as a core rulebook inDungeons \& Dragonsbut has also been remediated as a narrative-heavy submenu in several digital games. The authors find that the figure of the monstrous woman persists in games because of the widespread distribution of theMonster Manualto young men in hobby communities, the cultural influence ofDungeons \& Dragons, depictions of monstrosity that blend the erotic with the maternal, and the discursive categorization and objectification of the female body by ludic systems.},

Fiasco! is a part of a growing genre of collaborative roleplaying games (RPGs) that have important applications in the university classroom. Fiasco! is an innovative game system that upends the traditional model of Game Master-led RPGs to create a collaborative environment for players to create their own stories. This paper explores how the unique model embedded within Fiasco! can be employed as a pedagogical tool for active student-led learning.~ To showcase the pedagogical innovations of a game like Fiasco!, we present classroom applications in English, Anthropology, and Sociology. Our experiences teaching with Fiasco! show how quickly and intuitively the game can be integrated into curricula with significant benefits for student engagement and learning.~Roleplaying games that emphasize player agency, like Fiasco!, offer adaptive and innovative strategies for student-led learning in an interdisciplinary setting. Much as the structure of Fiasco! drives player engagement by making each player an equal participant in the generation of narrative content, using Fiasco! in the classroom allows each student an equal stake in developing course material. Beyond individual case studies, this article offers pedagogical inspiration for using Fiasco! in a variety of classroom settings that offer the possibility of an adaptive and interdisciplinary approach to student engagement.},

It has spawned bestselling comics, live shows and television adaptations. Unlike ‘Let’s Play’ videos on YouTube or game livestreaming on platforms like Twitch, there has been little in the way of critical analysis of this new media form. This article therefore aims to understand its audience(s) through qualitative and quantitative content analysis of survey responses from the fan communities of one of the most popular Actual Play shows,               The Adventure Zone               . We focus on the relationship between Actual Play’s attempts at creating more accessible and inclusive media that welcome all types of people and the more exclusionary, highly gendered aspects of the broader gaming community. These enquiries also serve as a case study for Actual Play as a less-examined area of both play spectatorship and gaming content creation, and points towards potential future study in these areas.                                         This article analyses Actual Play podcast               The Adventure Zone               to highlight the under-explored dynamics of fan audiences in this area of gaming content creation.

Specifically, it explores the game's story and environment by examining key characters? responses to structural inequalities through an anomie theory lens. Key characters and groups within the game exemplify Merton's (1938) different responses to rampant poverty and socioeconomic inequality. This is then extended to the ?cyberpsycho? problem within the game, incorporating General Strain Theory to discuss why specific individuals develop the problem within Cyberpunk 2077.},

This self-making and making-with is not understood in the sense of either self-possession or self-realization, but as a mode of what Stefano Harney and Fred Moten call "fugitive planning," a planning with the potential for direct action at the cosmic scale. This cosmic poetics is a poetics that rejects "the assignation of traits," as Legacy Russell beckons us to do, delighting in the glitched becomings of "generic difference." Bringing this theoretical constellation to ground, this paper examines select examples from the recent boom in independent "lyric" games, situating them in their experimental aesthetic context in order to derive a praxis for the elaboration of the poetics here described.},

With Rancière’s politics as a framework, this study works backward from Ian Bogost’s Persuasive Games (2007) to his Unit Operations (2006), and then to Alain Badiou’s Manifesto for Philosophy (1989), in order to recover the radical politics undergirding Bogost’s distinct method of game criticism. Badiou’s Manifesto, going beyond Bogost’s primary philosophical source, Badiou’s Being and Event (1988), clarifies the political stakes of Badiou’s ontology, allowing us to return to the present with a more robust politics of procedurality motivating our critical work. From here, Alder and Rosenbaum’s Dream Askew / Dream Apart (2018) furnishes us with a provocative model of emancipatory procedurality suited not only for radical play but radical design, challenging the limits of Bogost’s “persuasion” as an activist paradigm.},

It is this notion of animation that mobilizes this paper on Jesse Ross's tabletop roleplaying game Trophy Dark (2021), and which informed my own experience as simultaneous game facilitator and game design instructor for a class of fifteen undergraduate students. With a group split roughly in half between students with varying levels of experience with Dungeons \& Dragons (and solely Dungeons \& Dragons) and students with no tabletop roleplaying experience whatsoever, Trophy Dark, and specifically Ross's incursion "Witchwood," made for a group exercise in this animative witness to the "not ours" and "not us" of which Stengers writes. Rather than adopting a rationalist, critical separation from the play experience, or a romantic, reflective immersion in the play experience, this particular group of students discovered in Trophy Dark a vehicle for the "active," "transformative," and indeed "metamorphic" experience that Stengers describes, using the chosen incursion as an instrument for the shared dramatic failure that is "playing to lose," as advocated in Trophy Dark's player's guide. Stengers awakens her readers to a "rhizomatic" materialism, or a materialism of the "milieu," and together in the Witchwood we encountered the same. This paper charts the contours of our adventure.},

These elements we can appreciate from afar, as an audience, whether we are also participants, or even just someone going through larp documentation, be it design documents (larp-as-designed), photographs, video, written reflections, or costumes (larp-as-remembered). The larp as played, for the participants, has three additional ways to encounter beauty. In larp, the participants mutually play a world into being by improvising within the rules and structures given by the design, partaking in emergent co-creation through play and inter-immersion. Furthermore, participants engage in vulnerable and generous play while being mindful, embodied, and present. Yet they also remain reflexive about the conceit of larp and strive for structural and narrative excellence.},

  abstract = {In this Master’s thesis the pervasive larp Prosopopeia Bardo 2: Momentum is studied as a case example of how the consciously constructed diegetic realities of live action role-playing interact and clash with that of everyday life. The analysis of the player experience in Momentum is divided in three parts: how the frames of ordinary life and the game exist on top of each other, how the player slips from one frame to another, and how the participants of the game negotiate these frames with each other and with the non-participants they encounter.       The analysis is conducted using Erving Goffman’s (1974) frame analysis and Gary Alan Fine’s (1983) role-playing specific elaboration of it. It is based on participant observation, email interviews with the player before, during and after the games, as well as semi-structured interviews with half of the players after the game. In addition to the three frames that Fine has described in his study of tabletop role-playing games – the primary framework, the playing frame and the game frame – there are numerous other frames present in a pervasive larp. The participants shift between these numerous frames, but they also employ a dual vision, seeing the events both as ludic and as ordinary.       The work has been conducted as part of the EU-funded Integrated Project for Pervasive Gaming. The thesis tackles an isolated research question separated from the larger framework building on a theoretical framework developed in the context of IPerG by Markus Montola and Annika Waern. In addition to sociology the work builds on ludology (game studies).       In the thesis it is proposed that frame analysis is a good tool in uncovering the inner working of a pervasive larp. However, as a method it falls short when the analysis of the internal processes of a player is attempted. The thesis also offers results for the design theory of pervasive larps: It discusses what hinders and supports immersion and offers a general interaction model for socially expanded pervasive larps.},

Board games to sports, digital games to party games, gambling to role-playing games. They all share one thing in common: rules. Indeed, rules are the one and only thing game scholars agree is central to games. But what, in fact, are rules?~In The Rule Book, Jaakko Stenros and Markus Montola explore how different kinds of rules work as building blocks of games. Rules are constraints placed on us while we play, carving a limited possibility space for us. They also inject meaning into our play: without rules there is no queen in chess, no ball in Pong, and no hole in one in golf.             Stenros and Montola discuss how rules constitute games through five foundational types: the explicit statements listed in the official rules, the private limitations and goals players place on themselves, the social and cultural norms that guide gameplay, the external regulation the surrounding society places on playing, and the material embodiments of rules.~Depending on the game, rules can be formal, internal, social, external, or material.             By considering the similarities and differences of wildly different games and rules within a shared theoretical framework, The Rule Book renders all games more legible.},

It discusses the boundedness of play, games, and RPGs and explains the concepts of transgression, deviance, and safety, including safety techniques. The chapter describes three categories of transgressive role-play: adult play and imagination as deviant; violations of game rules and the concept of “game”; and, finally, violations of norms relating to the relationship between the player and the character. “Game” as a concept is a sociocultural artifact. In order to play games together, participants need to trust that they share similar enough ideas about how games are played and how involved one should become while playing. The chapter considers violations of the concept of game, specifically transgressing game rules, trust amongst players, and issues with involvement as well as boundedness and separation of playing from the quotidian.},

Pen-and-paper role-playing games (P\&P RPG) are a concept known since the early 1970s. Since then, the genre has attracted a massive community of players while branching out into several genres and P\&P RPG systems to choose from. Due to the highly interactive and dynamic nature of the game, a participants individual impact on narrative and interactive aspects of the game is extremely high. The diversity of scenarios within this context unfold a variety of players needs, as well as factors limiting and enhancing game-play. Companion offers an audio management workspace for creation and playback of soundscapes based on visual layouting. It supports interactive image presentation and map exploration which can incorporate input from any device providing TUIO tracking data. Additionally, a mobile app was developed to be used as a remote control for media activation on the desktop host.},

  abstract = {Game education, at its core, in addition to influencing the formation of children and teenagers, facilitating healthy growth, permanent enrichment, is part of the most uplifting spirit of democratic practice while investing in a serious production of knowledge. In this sense, it can be understood that pedagogical games can be a link between didactic practice and the success of the teaching and learning process, by providing creativity and interaction, as well as awakening the student’s interest and understanding, connecting their reality with the reality presented and lived in the English language classroom. Teachers' and students’ relation is transformed into a more dynamic activity, sharpening the latter’s curiosity and promoting knowledge. Although teachers are aware of the importance and efficiency of games as pedagogical resources, they rarely use them, especially during English classes. It is extremely important to introduce game activities in schools. These activities have the power to facilitate both the progress of the student’s integral personality and the progress of each of his psychological, intellectual and moral functions. In addition, lucidity not only influences children, but also brings several benefits to adults, who love to learn something while having fun. Thus, the importance of play in the school context is perceived, providing greater interaction between students and their learning, making content more attractive and meaningful, from the students’ perspective.},

In chapters contributed by experts in their fields, this book offers a systemic overview of how trauma impacts all humans, then delves into the manifestations of trauma in specific populations like BIPOC communities, neurodivergent children, and those in helping professions. The book's third and final section looks at emerging modalities for working with trauma and implications for the future of trauma-focused therapy. Ideal for anyone who works closely with individuals who have experienced trauma—therapists, educators, social workers, and beyond—Trauma Impacts will benefit from a thorough understanding on how trauma continues to influence lives, even long after the fact. Trauma can interfere with meeting basic needs, forming healthy relationships, and finding fulfillment in the pursuit of individual and collective goals. When we conceptualize these impacts, we become empowered to help people process their traumatic experiences, integrate the pain they have experienced, and lead more satisfying lives.  Understand the intersectional effects of trauma on individuals and systems Discover hope for healing through real-world voices and current research Consider how collective trauma manifests in the lives of individuals Gain insights that can help you work more effectively with clients},

The paper illustrates how youth critique and resist unjust societal norms while simultaneously envisioning queer utopian futures. Using a queer theory framework, the authors consider how youth performed disidentifications and queer futurity. Design/methodology/approach This study is a discourse analysis of approximately 85 hours of audio collected over one year. Findings Youth engaged in deconstructive critique, disidentifications and queer futurity in powerful enactments of critical literacies that involved simultaneous resistance, subversion, imagination and hope as youth envisioned queer utopian world-building through their fantasy storytelling. Youth acknowledged the injustice of the present while radically envisioning a utopian future. Originality/value This study offers an empirical grounding for critical literacies centered in queer theory and explores how youth engage with critical literacies in collaboratively co-authored texts. The authors argue that queering critical literacies potentially moves beyond deconstructive critique while simultaneously opening spaces for resistance, imagination and utopian world-making through linguistic and narrative-based tools.},

Players engage with religion and religious concepts in TRPGs through mechanics and system rules, setting, and interpersonal interactions with other gamers during the game session. Together these three facets of the TRPG experience create a bridge between the player and the game environment. This allows for players to experience the game setting as part of their conventional reality. Religious constructs erected in the game world and interacted with via the player's character, become authentic expressions of religion worthy of study by scholars of religion. Religion becomes actualized by the player as he translates the experience of his character into personal experience with the game environment. Mechanics help facilitate that translation by creating the liminal space of the game. Rules and system create boundaries for the game that creates the place where religious play can occur. setting then fills the liminal space providing the environment that is explored, creating an understandable engagement with religious components of the game. Lastly, the act of play, by the player, creates religious belief within the setting. Taken together the game experience of the TRPG is actuated to conventional religious experience, which opens it up as a subject for religious study.},

  abstract = {First created in 1974, the largest table-top role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) started out as a war game where multiple players could join in and fight monsters. Grounded in fantasy conventions and as a way to explore fantasy genres, Dungeons \& Dragons popularity continued through new editions and add-ons. In addition, Dungeons \& Dragons legacy has lived on in the gaming world as the father of most RPGs and fantasy games with a large fan following across various editions and over multiple decades. The fan following is still evident today due to D\&D’s foundations in high fantasy. An exploration of the ways in which fantasy narrative plays a role in the fan culture of D\&D is necessary to understand how the aspects of fantasy affect gameplay and how players view D\&D. By conducting a study of Dungeons \& Dragons players which focused on close game play, players’ relationships to other fantasy genres, and how players interacted with game conventions, I explored the ways in which Dungeons \& Dragons introduced players to fantasy and how they participated in a fandom. This paper will present the findings of the study as well as situate Dungeons \& Dragons in relationship to other fantasy and gaming subcultures.},

  abstract = {This MA thesis examines the relationship between tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) and convergence culture. As a genre, TRPGs are characterized by multi-author collaboration and narrative agency for participants. Drawing upon the text of a pre-written scenario, as well as audio recordings from a play-through of that scenario, this essay catalogs significant points of departure between the two. This demonstrates the limits of authority between different types of authors (i.e. game designers, module writers, game masters, and players). It also reveals the points at which these roles bleed into one another, showing that professional and amateur authors are participating in much the same activity despite their apparent differences. Because TRPGs are predicated on creating texts in which amateur authors are engaged in the same work as their professional counterparts, and because texts are created with the expectation of input from lower-order authors, TRPGs represent a uniquely democratic form of convergence culture.},

In this article, I describe one sort of entertainment activity, science-fiction-based, roleplaying games.

  abstract = {Scholars who study learning in video games draw direct parallels to tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) like Dungeons \& Dragons in terms of the underlying principles that enhance learning. In fact, tabletop RPGs have formed the statistical, and sometimes creative, basis for many of the most popular role-playing video games to date, so why is it that tabletop RPGs have been largely neglected in favor of the video game variety? This study takes a close look at how one particular group of players of Dungeons \& Dragons engages the game as both a game and as an act of narrative creation. Their interactions can reveal something about how storytelling has changed in response to changes in technology and how this contributes to learning within various domains. In conducting this study, the author observed the group play and also became a participant in the experience to better understand how this group functions. Observation and interaction with these players show that they create stories that are not confined by the traditional boundaries of narrative, such as having a beginning, middle, and end. These stories are not confined to a single method of communication; the group takes advantage of music, films, objects, and even an online forum to expand their narratives across multiple media. The members of this group collectively and actively write their stories, all the while remaining aware that they are in fact creating a story. They challenge each other to improve and collectively work to become better, smarter role-players and narrative writers.},

Though there has been some interest in sociological and ethnographic research in the broader realm of role-playing games as a whole, minimal research exists specifically examining the therapeutic applications of tabletop role-playing games (e.g., Dungeons \& Dragons). The purpose of this capstone is to examine the limited existing research on therapeutic applications of tabletop role-playing games, to ground the use of this intervention in other, well-established modalities, and to make links with related areas of research such as in education and learning and the field of simulation training. Further, this paper seeks to understand reasons why therapeutically applied tabletop role-playing games remain widely under-researched in academia, and to identify possible barriers to access. The final purpose of this paper is to discuss ways to lower and eliminate barriers to access, as well as to suggest a possible outreach program to educate adult gatekeepers for youth engagement in therapeutically applied tabletop role-playing game programs, as improving social skills in youth has been demonstrated to be a positive outcome of this intervention.},

  abstract = {From Spacewar to the persistent multiplayer worlds of the 21st century, video games have moved from subculture to mainstream industry and various genres also have emerged. Among the genres, role-playing games (RPGs) require special attention, and readers of this chapter should be familiar with the concept of role-playing. RPGs are interactive worlds where players assume the roles of fictional characters and determine their own actions based on the character they play. Players typically follow a storyline in a fictional world and interact with other player (PCs) or non-player characters (NPCs) to complete missions and achieve various goals. As the player completes quests and overcomes conflicts, his/her character advances in levels and becomes stronger. Tabletop fantasy RPGs have parallels to wargames and educational simulations, but they focus more on the role and player choices are virtually unlimited (Fine, 1983). The key difference between tabletop RPGs (or FRPs) and computer RPGs is that the video game is no longer a collectively produced fantasy and takes place within strictly defined parameters (Apperley, 2006). These games were being played in many cities in Turkey, especially in İstanbul in the mid-1990s. To make a more detailed examination of the evolution and the current state of this subculture, an analysis of the late 1990s’ FRP Cafés would be undeniably noteworthy...},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study on two Tabletop Roleplaying Games, Dungeons \& Dragons and Blades in the Dark. This paper takes a look at the narrative differences within the two systems. More specifically investigate if Blades in the Dark is more playerdriven than Dungeons \& Dragons. The two tested as closely as possible and will be compared with each other. This is a close reading on the rules and player agency rather than a one-on-one comparison. The comparisons were made regarding the mechanics and narrative differences within the systems rather than quality of the story. This study was conducted by running two sessions, one for each system, played by separate groups with the same game scenario and premise. Meaning that the background for both games, character and plot for the session were the same. Comparisons were made by observing player decisions, situations that arose and the influence that the gamemasters had on the game. It was found that there is a clear difference between the two systems, this difference regarding whether the players were reacting to the gamemaster, or the other way round. In Dungeons \& Dragons, it was observed that the players reacted and acted according to what the gamemaster explained and played out, whereas in Blades in the Dark it appeared to be the opposite. Here we found that it was the Gamemaster who was reactive to the players instead. The paper concluded that Blades in the Dark is the more player-driven system. This short study could later be built upon and used by game developers to keep in mind and plan their future game systems around. Taking these observations on emergent narrative in Tabletop Role-playing Games into account can be used to create more player-centric and player-driven games. Meaning that the players are more in influence and decisions to make in the story and game.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing has grown from a niche of analog gaming into a mainstay of popular culture. The original face-to-face way of playing has been complemented by online play using dedicated digital tools, and play itself has become spectator entertainment. In this article, I explore the process of mediatization of tabletop role-playing on the example of Critical Role – the most successful ‘actual play’ show, in which performers broadcast tabletop role-playing to audiences. I highlight the importance of commodification as a force in the process of mediatization, involving licensing, merchandising, and advertising. Empirically, the article is grounded in an analysis of Critical Role’s sponsorships and embodied player practices, focusing on the political-economic aspects of the show. While Critical Role presents a profoundly mediated form of tabletop role-playing, it promotes a traditional face-to-face way of playing using physical accessories both by cast members’ preference of such accessories (except for the digital toolset D\&D Beyond) and sponsorships from manufacturers of these products. Mediatization of tabletop role-playing thus happens through an economic-driven process of addition – new mediated options for players with new opportunities for commodification exist alongside analog modes of consumption. As shown on the example of Critical Role, the digital and mediated forms of the analog hobby can be harnessed to promote physical consumerism.},

Using the character creation outline from the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, students role-play their created entrepreneur as a character with chosen attributes through storytelling. This encourages outside-the-box thinking and the allowance for creativity in a novel and interesting way, all while engaging with the course content. We highlight not only the activity but also how this is a useful exercise for students in practicing entrepreneurial scenarios and considering the relationship between entrepreneurial attributes and outcomes.

  abstract = {This article describes the use of the materiality of the medieval book as a trope of medievalism in neomedieval games. It argues that the materiality of the hybrid writing/printing book culture evoked in these games does not correspond with any given historical period, not even the late 15th-century technical transition from writing to print culture; instead, the games synthesize a variety of details from separate historical periods into a coherent neomedieval book culture that supports player immersion. The player's relationship with this neomedieval book culture is fostered through representations of the materiality of the medieval book, though this materiality can be represented in images or in text, in the game environment or in the user interface. Handling manuscripts and deciphering texts is an important component of the fantasy sought by the audience of neomedieval role-playing games.},

The media and conservative religious groups have largely perpetuated the stigma associated with this subculture.  This study takes a closer look at the stigma as seen from non-members and members of the sub-culture.  By introducing non-members to the culture we can see how their negative preconceptions changed to a greater amount of acceptance.  I found that with introduction, the negative image of role-playing games was reversed. Additionally I looked at the perceptions of experienced gamers and found that the group interaction is seen as the greatest benefit of being part of the sub-culture.},

  abstract = {In this article, I present a case study of the serious role-play game The People, which was created as a response to the migration crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border in cooperation with an engaged collective of researchers and groups of activists. The game combines elements of role-playing, a board game, and cards to present the complexity of the situation in the Emergency State Zone on the Polish-Belarusian border, especially on the practical, social, and institutional levels. The purpose of the tool is to raise the participants’ awareness of the current situation and to enhance an active search for solutions to the crisis. The game enables participants to adopt a perspective of a border zone resident or a refugee, and ultimately modify the rules governing the world to make it fairer. Providing the participants with agency to reconstruct the game environment during the debriefing made it possible to generate numerous possible solutions at the level of direct interventions; e.g., providing shelters in forests, training residents in first aid; legal, e.g., access by doctors and media, allowing humanitarian organizations; and executive, e.g., more effective enforcement of European law. Also, the exposure to goals inconsistent with personal views under significant immersion evokes various strategies to deal with the clash, including passive agreement, rationalization, gentle disagreement, and extreme disagreement. Such a game can inspire a positive change in the level of participants’ understanding, interesting solutions, activist attitudes, and empathy towards asylum seekers. However, the game can also expose the dangerous, existing mechanisms that pose a challenge to society, and what should be monitored and possibly mitigated in the future.},

  abstract = {A textual analysis of games of the MIT Assassins’ Guild with an ethnographic and historical slant provides an analysis of five kinds of tensions in the process of the design and the implementation of mechanics in MIT Assassins’ Guild Live-Action Roleplaying games. These tensions are a product of a combination of the history of roleplaying games and other Live-Action simulative activities, the specific logistical and historical circumstances of the MIT Assassins’ Guild and the expectations of the members of the MIT Assassins’ Guild. Game designers and players frequently cite case studies and have developed a useful vocabulary that are worth learning to facilitate further discussion of game design. Guild game mechanics are designed for feasibility of implementation and execution by the game designers and the players, to provide and hide information from players in a timely manner, to dissociate player decisions from character actions, to enhance the verisimilitude and the atmosphere of the game for the players, and to generate, balance and resolve interesting competition among players. Experienced game designers keep all these tensions in mind while designing mechanics that can satisfy all the criteria and highlight desirable traits that arise from the interplay of the tensions.},

A research gap exists as TTRPG in Singapore, a new but growing imported Western game model has not caught the attention of scholars. In-depth qualitative interviews with 15 players revealed that players in Singapore subscribe to similar traits of good gamer, as Western players. It also contributes to understanding how these traits are ranked and what behaviours discourage future play between players. Our study revealed that there are tensions between the cooperative nature of the game vis-à-vis the competitive spirit of players, as evident from traits of bad gamers described by our respondents. Our study also contributes to the field of roleplay studies by showing how TTRPG is played and why it is a growing phenomenon by explaining how it differs from online gaming. We argue that gaming presents an interesting window into societal values, beyond the reported benefits of TTRPG in education and socialization.

We then process these interactions to render a story following the rules and using the knowledge base from a popular RPG. Finally, we control parameters present in the narrative RPG ruleset to tweak the resulting story, such as the presence of mental, physical and social challenges, as well as the amount of protagonism that each player has.},

This article offers queer temporality as a lens through which to unravel the 12 steps of Vogler’s hero’s journey, informed by queer theory’s critiques of the 8 steps of the heteronormative life journey . It joins other studies critiquing the paradigm from other standpoints, including Indigenous screen storytelling, gaming and interactive narratives, and for development of characters disenfranchised by gender and/or circumstance. Others note the model’s increasing irrelevance as writers uncover its limitations for creative processes of story development. This article homes in on how studies of queer temporalities – rejecting ‘dominant temporal logics’ and ‘chrononormativity’, replacing ‘straight time’ with ‘queer time’, can further destabilise the hero’s journey’s dominance in story development by exploring the breadth of practices in creative writing and screen production beyond the universalising models.},

Through an interview study, we investigate how eight expert game masters adapt everyday technologies and materials as creativity support tools (CSTs) for improvisational and collaborative play. We integrate theories of improvisational and distributed creativity with the human-artifact model, which provides an activity-theoretical vocabulary for analyzing the mediating relationships between specialist practitioners and their tools. We show how GMs prepare and deploy readymade artifacts: analog and digital CSTs that flexibly mediate recurring creative tasks in their practice, such as improvising narrative elements, facilitating smooth play, and creating aesthetic effects. We find that GMs demonstrate designerly thinking as they create, share, and refine repertoires of readymade artifacts. We argue that our theoretical approach can inform future studies of IT-mediated creativity, and that readymade artifacts can be an analytical and generative concept for the design of novel creativity support tools.},

The various leading theories for categorizing roleplaying experiences, scenarios and communication will be briefly introduced, along with the relevant theories from the field of interactive narratives, after which the participants will be given the opportunity to participate in one of a representative sample of short-form scenarios. The workshop will conclude with a general discussion and experience-sharing session intended to relate the scenario play-throughs and covered theories with the participants’ general work within the field of interactive narratives.},

  abstract = {The author’s research team has been conducting “Libardry” a game-type library guidance program to learn how to use university libraries. However, in the fiscal year 2020, university libraries had to be closed due to the influence of preventing the spread of the new coronavirus. Under these circumstances, many university libraries attempted to provide library guidance online. In the same way, the author’s research team tried to create a library guidance “Libardry Form” which does not rely on any paid tools or special skills. Based on the research team’s prior experiences with game-type library guidance, we conducted an exploratory study to understand the game’s impact on library learning. Concretely, for a trial survey of the features of the “Libardry Form” we recruited eleven university students during classes taught by the first author and thirty-one participants from the general public via SNS. After playing the game, we asked the participants to fill out a questionnaire. Thirty-three respondents (78.6\%) preferred our game-type library guidance to the more common video-type guidance. We also asked the eleven university students who experienced the game to cooperate with us for additional pre- and post-surveys and analyzed the results of the eight valid responses we received. We found that it was difficult to recognize the influence of the “Libardry Form” on sophomore and junior students who had used university libraries before. Contrastingly, although it is not possible to generalize the results due to the small number of valid responses, the results indicate that the “Libardry Form” may improve the understanding of freshmen who have little experience using university libraries.},

Based on five months of anthropological research in the United Kingdom, its aim is to place LARP within the context of existing anthropology on play and performance and examine how LARP constructs an alternate reality for the players. LARP is separated from the mundane world by the “magic circle”, created by explicit rules and the social contract. In game, players strive for immersion, similar to the concept of flow, in which players feel that they are their characters. This immersion is enabled by character performance, a fully sensorial atmosphere, and personal relationships between the characters. Once immersed, players no longer feel as if they are acting, but rather that the character has taken over. This immersion allowed players to enter the Enchanted State and an alternate reality in which characters are performative and actions within game were referred to as authentic. This adult play allows players to construct a fragile alternate reality based on the belief of its players.},

The case in question focuses on Riotminds, a Swedish RPG publishing company that in 2010, in one broad stroke, transformed and converged all their analogue printed products into a single, online subscription service. Drawing on a general theoretical framework of materiality and (cultural) practice, the purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of digitization by asking: What does this particular instance of technological transformation and expressions of resistance reveal about materiality and the ongoing tensions between what constitutes meaningful digital and analogue immersive experiences? The results contribute to a critical, materialist perspective on digitization that encompasses both Digital’s virtues and challenges in terms of the digital transformation of physical practices and physical space. In other words, forwarding an understanding of digitalization as an intricate aesthetic shift, where identified analog sensibilities are converted into digital sensibilities, and its consequences for creating meaningful gaming experiences on behalf of the user (or player).},

  abstract = {This article presents a critical view of the concept of rules in game studies on the basis of a case study of role-playing across media. Role-playing in its traditional form is a complex activity including a game system and a number of communicative conventions where one player takes the role of the game manager in order to implement the rules and provide a world for the other players. In online role-playing games, a programmed system simulates the rule system as well as part of the game manager's tasks, while the rest of the activity is up to the players to define. Some aspects may translate more or less unproblematically across media, others are transformed by the introduction of the programmed system. This reveals some important perspectives on the sort of rules that can be simulated in a programmed system and what this means to the concept of rules in game studies.},

With the increasing use of role-playing games to convey history and heritage, the Bergmann Hammings’ design patterns both evince a particular interpretation of that history and also demonstrate how future designers might generally adapt such material into role-playable forms.},

Part of this research involved using game design to teach topics from various disciplines, with students making, hacking, and modding games to achieve educational goals in STEM, literature, social studies, theatre, and emergent topics. During that time, I led two teams that worked through trial and error to develop a teaching methodology that I call Gamemaking in Education (GME). This educational approach emphasizes student gamemaking rather than gameplay. In this paper, I discuss what GME is, review some cases in which other educators have used what might be called GME in college classrooms, and situate GME as an application of other proven educational methods including the maker movement in education, project-based learning, and experiential learning. I also offer strategizes for those who wish to implement GME in their classrooms, along with some recommendations for those who wish to engage in future study of GME.},

Talsorian Games (RTG). His instrumental role in creating Cyberpunk (1988), among other tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) cannot be overstated. Cyberpunk helped establish the aesthetic and mechanical basis for all future cyberpunk game franchises, including Shadowrun (1989–), Deus Ex (2000–), SLA Industries (1993), and Invisible, Inc. (2015). Cyberpunk 2020 (1990), the best-known edition of his TRPG, is set in Night City, an American dystopian metropolis that features cyber-equipped, street-savvy mercenaries (“edgerunners”) who stylishly break into secure facilities to extract valuable goods. These edgerunners are “survivors in a tough, grim world, faced with life and death choices […The] quintessential Cyberpunk character is a rebel with a cause” (Pondsmith et al. 3). Pondsmith envisioned the TRPG prose and game mechanics required for players to successfully run their own cyberpunk stories and established the boundaries, norms, values, and verbs of most successor cyberpunk game titles.},

Although much is said at convention panels and around the gaming table, it focuses on publicly accessible written work. RPG theorizing serves numerous explicit and implicit purposes. It can help us play better: theorycrafting, the “modeling and testing theories about the underlying mechanics of a game,” helps MMORPG players advance through their games. Before diving into the history of RPG theorizing, it is helpful to see this dynamic play out in one prominent debate: realism versus playability—whether rules should simulate reality or follow their own internal logic. Early RPG theory evolved from small press wargaming and science-fiction and fantasy newsletters. Their conversations focused on how to adapt historical material into game form, the proper procedure of play-by-mail games, or the mentioned realism versus playability debate.},

Se trata de un estudio global e integral de este medio que aportará la primera revisión bibliográfica exhaustiva dentro del ámbito español, junto con algunas propuestas metodológicas que podrán abrir la puerta a futuras investigaciones. Para ello, se tomará como base una participación activa en larps de carácter narrativo e inmersivo, junto con entrevistas a un corpus seleccionado de diseñadores españoles, de cara a integrar una visión interna de esta comunidad. Así, se examinarán las características ludonarrativas, estructurales, temáticas, contextuales e intermediales del rol en vivo, además de su convergencia con otras formas de expresión artística y mediática —como el teatro o los propios juegos de rol de mesa—, todo ello con una especial atención a sus posibles componentes colaborativos y relacionados con el contenido fan.},

  abstract = {Fostering spoken communication in a foreign language classroom is not an easy task. With that in mind, this paper explores a proposal to motivate students’ L2 oral communication through the practice of narrative games called tabletop roleplaying games adapted as task-based activities. It implied an action research process in which the teacher-researcher with his students reflected and intervened on the identified problematic situation: Lack of oral communication in L2. In that sense, it started with a diagnostic test that showed the current state of verbal communication in L2 in a Colombian rural public school. Next, the teacher-researcher chose to appeal to the gamification of the classroom along with the adoption of a task-based framework to activity design aiming to improve students’ motivation to take the risk of communicating in L2. The teacher-researcher applied sets of activities that progressed from traditional role-play to a tabletop roleplaying game. In accordance, video recordings, narratives, artifacts collections, and semi-structured interviews were essential to collect data. Afterward, the teacher-researcher analyzed the data with an emic approach to identify patterns in the information that uncovered the categories and subcategories of information. Consequently, the teacher-researcher concluded that the students feel better motivated using L2 if the learning environment offers opportunities for social interaction, collaborative work, and scaffolding in task-based exercises embedded in a fictional world game.},

Starting with a gentle introduction to old school tabletop RPGs by way of their history and a rundown of the most popular titles, the authors walk librarians through the complete process of adding these games to their collection, discussing the qualities one should look for when considering what games to select, the technical aspects of cataloging them, and cementing RPGs as a bona fide resource rather than a bait-and-switch diversion. Torres-Roman and Snow aren't afraid to give real, practical advice about dealing with problem patrons and the potentially emotionally charged environment of gaming. Appendices include a guide to current games, with an easy-to-understand ratings system that allows review of the game's key parameters at a glance, and a list of games tagged by genre. VERDICT Librarians who have been successfully integrating role-playing games into their programs for some time won't find much new here, but those who are just experimenting with the medium will see that as an invaluable guide, and even those seasoned pros could use it as a handy desk reference.},

Es quizás por este auge de tecnologías que surgió en el año 2003, la herramienta virtual Second Life ; concebida como un mundo complejo y completamente virtual que permite a los usuarios aprender y vivir en otra realidad como si se trata de la película “avatar”. Es por ello que este trabajo pretende conocer y comprender si existe relación entre el uso de la herramienta Second Life y el aprendizaje situado, utilizando una metodología cualitativa donde se empleó la etnografía virtual, la observación participante y la entrevista a profundidad; de colectivos humanos vinculados a las tecnologías, se analizó el entorno del ciberespacio, concretamente el Second Life (SL), a partir de lo que cinco participantes decían, pensaban o hacían, mediante sus avatares. La investigación se guía bajo los supuestos de que la herramienta enfatiza el contexto cultural en el que tiene lugar la adquisición de habilidades sociales e intelectuales, también se pretendía conocer si el uso de SL podía trasladarse a un plano educativo, asimismo se planteó la probabilidad de que la herramienta impide o potenciara el aprendizaje en el plano virtual (aprendizaje Situado). En este mismo sentido se conoció, de manera particular la forma de significar el tiempo de conectividad, los aprendizajes y experiencias del grupo Crimson o Carmesí de Vampiro: La Mascarada, un juego de rol adaptado a Second Life, sus conceptos, estereotipos, atributos a su realidad, ser o situación, así como a las percepciones que hacen sobre su propia participación en este submundo},

An analysis of these two classes shows a community eager to use game rule algorithms as a way to center sexuality in their play. We argue that these communities provide evidence of how the Dungeons \& Dragons ruleset provided a boiler-plate for game rules that support the norms of hegemonic masculinity and have influenced the culture of toxic masculinity in game algorithms today.},

I look toward hobby games and hobbyists to recuperate a more complete genealogical understanding of white masculinity in geek culture. As a method, genealogy helps to reveal the complex and often counterintuitive ways that subjectivity is produced, normalized, and made invisible. My historical work shows that unlike the Irish—who cast themselves as white in order to gain social privilege in America’s racist society —hobbyists see themselves as outsiders. The denial of white male privilege established by hobbyists continues to define the socio-technical space of geek culture today.}

  abstract = {How have the ways we imagine and understand games changed since World War II? Play and games, although inextricably connected, have come to mean quite different things in the early twenty-first century popular culture, and I argue that this change is a cultural product of The Cold War. Today, games are described as products, systems, and even rituals. It is assumed that all games have rules, and these rules are shared through code, manuals, and sometimes oral tradition. Whereas games are systems, play is the embodied phenomenon associated with navigating such systems. Play relates specifically to bodies, and is often—though not necessarily always—connected to games. The nature of games and play is generally agreed upon in both popular discourse and by game studies scholarship. People play games, people play with each other, and the essence of play cannot be reduced to any one product, container, system of rules, or even social ritual. Rules may contort the dynamics of play, but they cannot define the essence of the phenomenon. Building on these distinctions, this dissertation claims, first, that our definitions of games and play are discursively contingent. Second, it develops this point by showing how in the latter half of the twentieth century, games began to be explicitly valorized over play. Games are typically seen as valuable, productive, and potentially transformative, while play is normally associated with leisurely, childish, and chaotic behavior. Third, alongside the valorization of games over play there has emerged a discourse that this dissertation terms the ludic imagination in which “truth” is conflated with quantitative and competitive logics. The ludic imagination contributes to other studies of the Cold War by focusing on the value placed on rationality as well as the affects of isolation and fear that characterize the era’s popular culture and military policy. I use correspondence, internal reports and memos from the RAND Corporation Archive and The MIT Center for International Studies, as well as hobby publications and trade publications from The Ray Browne Popular Culture Archive and the Dragon Magazine CD-ROM Archive in order to reveal a historical arc that connects military ideology around games and play to popular culture. This arc includes documentation from the RAND Corporation, correspondence within a grassroots network of gamers that included play-by-mail Diplomacy hobbyists, and the design notes of Dungeons \& Dragons players. Through these primary sources, I show how networks of military elites at the RAND Corporation overlapped with networks of grassroots hobbyists and together imagined the intersection of games and play. This reading evaluates the limits of these terms by considering how racism, sexism, and homophobia collude with the quantitative and essentialist worldview of military logistics. Here I evaluate the indebtedness of the ludic imagination to a reductionist and pragmatist military ideology and consider what potentials exist to play with its future definition.},

It takes a historical approach that is grounded in Foucauldian genealogy, arguing that the cultures of masculinity in Dungeons \& Dragons can be discursively traced through published manuals and articles about the game. Drawing on fan conversations found in The Dragon, it compares the representations of masculinity found in these historic texts to the ways that masculinity is represented today in the fifth edition of Dungeons \& Dragons. In staging this comparison, it shows how depictions of masculinity have progressed over the 40-year life span of Dungeons \& Dragons, but also how they have stayed the same.},

  abstract = {The story of white masculinity in geek culture through a history of hobby gaming Geek culture has never been more mainstream than it is now, with the ever-increasing popularity of events like Comic Con, transmedia franchising of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, market dominance of video and computer games, and the resurgence of board games such as Settlers of Catan and role-playing games like Dungeons \& Dragons. Yet even while the comic book and hobby shops where the above are consumed today are seeing an influx of BIPOC gamers, they remain overwhelmingly white, male, and heterosexual. The Privilege of Play contends that in order to understand geek identity’s exclusionary tendencies, we need to know the history of the overwhelmingly white communities of tabletop gaming hobbyists that preceded it. It begins by looking at how the privileged networks of model railroad hobbyists in the early twentieth century laid a cultural foundation for the scenes that would grow up around war games, role-playing games, and board games in the decades ahead. These early networks of hobbyists were able to thrive because of how their leisure interests and professional ambitions overlapped. Yet despite the personal and professional strides made by individuals in these networks, the networks themselves remained cloistered and homogeneous—the secret playgrounds of white men. Aaron Trammell catalogs how gaming clubs composed of lonely white men living in segregated suburbia in the sixties, seventies and eighties developed strong networks through hobbyist publications and eventually broke into the mainstream. He shows us how early hobbyists considered themselves outsiders, and how the denial of white male privilege they established continues to define the socio-technical space of geek culture today. By considering the historical role of hobbyists in the development of computer technology, game design, and popular media, The Privilege of Play charts a path toward understanding the deeply rooted structural obstacles that have stymied a more inclusive community. The Privilege of Play concludes by considering how digital technology has created the conditions for a new and more diverse generation of geeks to take center stage.},

  abstract = {Originally presented online at MET Conference: Neuroscience and Theater Therapy, Bucharest, Romania, May 28, 2021. This presentation from members of the Transformative Play Initiative at he Uppsala University Campus Gotland's discusses the potential of live action role-playing games (larps) as vehicles for embodied experiential learning and therapeutic interventions.  Presenters:  Elektra Diaklolambrianou, Institution for Counseling and Psychological Studies Josephine Baird, Uppsala University Josefin Westborg, Uppsala University Sarah Lynne Bowman, Uppsala University Larp is a type of improvisational performance that involves spontaneous co-creation between players enacting characters in a fictional setting for a bounded period of time. This format encourages agency and collaboration as a means to playfully co-construct identity and reality within a group setting, which can lead to an increased sense of internal locus of control, as well as meta-reflection. This presentation contextualizes larp with relationship to other therapeutic modalities that use storytelling and/or role enactment , e.g. psychodrama, sociodrama, Gestalt, narrative therapy, Integral Family Systems, inner child work, drama therapy, person-centred therapy etc. The presenters discuss some of the cognitive elements that make larp particularly useful as a tool, including the development of perspective taking, empathy, and metacognitive awareness through the dual consciousness of identification with character and aesthetic distancing. The presentation explore larp’s potential as a vehicle for learning -- including its limitations -- with an emphasis on theories of assimilation, accommodation, and cognitive dissonance, e.g. Knud Illeris’ work building upon concepts from Jean Piaget.  The presentation discusses a specific example of the ways players can use larp as a playground to experiment with identity and personally transform. This example centers upon player who use role-playing as a space for queer performance where they can feel secure enough in their containment to physically present as different gender identities than were assigned to them at birth. This process can not only feel radically liberating for queer participants, but can be paired with adjunctive therapeutic modalities to aid in their process of transitioning their gender socially outside of playful spaces. Thus, this presentation considers the potential of larp as a transformational container or holding environment for experimentation that can support other therapeutic processes occurring parallel to play.

MR offers new ways of building on these elements to enhance the immersive and haptic interactive gameplay experience while retaining the popular elements of TTRPGs. This research explores the technical possibilities and limitations of holographic headsets such as the Microsoft Hololens with the purpose of enhancing immersion within encounters in the TTRPG experience.},

Data analysis involved reviewing the recorded gameplay sessions, transcribing dialogue, and categorizing qualitative feedback provided by both the new players and experienced DMs. The preliminary study demonstrates that ChatGPT has the potential to act as a Dungeon Master (DM) and provide a fast introduction to the experience of playing Dungeons \& Dragons for new players.

The article qualitatively analyzes available sources, the recollections of those who took part in the vacation program, mainly from the ‘50s to the ‘70s, and diaries written on site in order to determine what forms of transformative play were present at Bánk that established a unique heritage of educational role-playing in Hungary. We go through all the identifying elements and themes and show how Bánk was a fertile soil for more complex forms of play to emerge. We compare our results with different definitions of role-playing and child’s play in general in order to determine to what extent the more complex forms of play at Bánk can be called larp, what key characteristics of it might differ from those of larp, and whether these differences serve a certain purpose.},

Media which are supportive of science stories or programs should be targeted and scientists should become more active at pitching stories. (AQES) The Rolling Stories project turns the AQES call to target media which are supportive of ‘science stories’ into a design activity where scientists are encouraged to both tell their stories and communicate them through creating Table-top Role Playing Games (TRPGs) and then playing them with students. The project goals support the AQES goals of increasing student participation, public engagement and scientists’ participation. The project expects outcomes in terms of increased engagement through the workshop series and long-lasting outcomes in the form of TRPG game books that can then be shared and re- used in educational and professional contexts.},

  abstract = {Creating multiple clinically realistic virtual patients (VPs) is a daunting, time-consuming process whereby time saved with a basic template still requires the end-user to populate physical exam, laboratory investigations and physiological data specifi cally to the nuances of each case. Within the gaming domain, it is common to populate multiple characters within a game by randomizing a range of values or characteristics (e.g. eye colour, height, weapons). Transferred to the clinical context, the ability to randomize all laboratory and other investigation results to default within the range of accepted physiological parameters for each fi nding allowed the University of Calgary to rapidly create ninety-seven VPs with clinically appropriate alphanumeric normal values. Using spreadsheet and database software, randomization was achieved by establishing the range of normal laboratory results. In addition, patient background, such as marital status, occupation, and so forth were also generated for each VP. These data-populated VPs were then imported into Open Labyrinth, where Subject Matter Expert time was condensed to providing abnormal findings to fit the context of the clinical presentation and desired diagnosis. The combination of common offi ce productivity software and an open source VP platform allows others to leverage the same process for local curricular VP-based programs. This technique also optimizes programmer, instructional designer and subject matter expert time commitments to the project.},

The functionality of the GM across game platforms is directly related to a handful of variables.In spite of being a core concept in role playing games, the full range of tools provided to GMs have not been fully integrated across the game platforms. The introduction of GM functionality in multiplayer computer role playing games such as Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption and Neverwinter Nights, indicate a substantial potential for development of toolsets for human-controlled interactive, emergent storytelling environments in virtual worlds, at several levels of functionality. Giving control of the game world to the players encourages a dynamic form of storytelling in games which is more reactive, and tailored to the specific players, than what is currently possible using pre-programmed static narratives or automated storytelling engines.},

  abstract = {Communication is a vital component of multi-player game play, constituting a large part of the player interaction in most game formats. In this article, the structure and intensity of the verbal communication between players in three different types of multiplayer role-playing games are analyzed. Data is drawn from a series of empirical experiments covering: A) Console gaming; B) Multiple players in a conventional LAN-setup, and: C) non-digital tabletop gaming. The results indicate that there are distinct differences in the overall communication pattern between the three game setups. When players share a single screen they communicate more than when each person has their own monitor, indicating a direct effect of the representation of the game medium on player communication. Additionally, in the digital games, speech intensity varies as a function of the game content: Players communicate the most during non-stressful game segments, and the least during intensive combat scenes, although the latter does require extensive coordination. The implication of this result is that analysis of player communication has the potential to be used as symptoms of boredom or excitement.},

Despite their popularity, empirical studies of these games are relatively rare. In particular there have been few examinations of the effects of the various formats used by RPGs on the gaming experience. This article presents the results of an empirical study, examining how multi-player tabletop RPGs are affected as they are ported to the digital medium. Issues examined include the use of disposition assessments to predict play experience, the effect of group dynamics, the influence of the fictional game characters and the comparative play experience between the two formats. The results indicate that group dynamics and the relationship between the players and their digital characters, are integral to the quality of the gaming experience in multiplayer RPGs, with the first being of greater importance to digital games and the latter to the tabletop version.},

Despite the popularity of these games, especially within computer games, and the possibility that experiences from RPGs could be used in designing interactive storytelling systems for next generation interactive entertainment systems, there have been very few academic studies focused on cross-platform studies of role playing games. In this paper, the results of a comparative analysis of pen and paper RPGs and computer RPGs, using an information systems perspective coupled with games analysis, is presented. The differences of the two game forms revolve around the different media formats and the limitations these impose and the options they provide. The formation of the collaborative story is a core feature of these games. While the formation of the storyline in multiplayer RPGs are complex, it appears that information systems modeling of multiplayer RPG story and control processes enables quantifiable modeling of an interactive storytelling systems.},

Gaming is used to communicate and perform cultural capital and identity through fictional narratives, functioning as a form of community building and/or personal expression. With quotations from ethnographic research over the course of 2 years, including interviews with several groups of gamers and participant observation, I examine the ways that players create and affirm social bonds. I return to Michel De Certeau's idea of textual poaching, as adapted by Henry Jenkins, to contrast with it a new concept of genre farming. As both platform for and object of genre farming, RPGs allow players to display cultural competence, create and reaffirm social ties, and seek entertainment in a collaborative fashion.},

  abstract = {With the new possibilities of social media and streaming services, some narratives like table-top role-playing games seem to find their way through pop culture. Their repercussion and referencing in TV shows and the Internet support the increasing awareness in pop culture at the same time that this sort of games is re-configured to meet the modern times in media, keeping their essence of pen, paper and friends around a table. This dissertation analyses the influence of the game in modern texts through its highest representative, Dungeons \& Dragons. The successful show Stranger Things serves the purpose of analysing how the nostalgia created around the eighties and its aesthetic use of Dungeons \& Dragons as vehicle for the main elements of plot and the focalised vision of the same. The live streaming of role-play sessions has also helped in this spread of the community, like Critical Role, allowing a higher engagement of the audience through the ease of the relaxed atmosphere of friends enjoying their hobby, yet reaching almost a professional level of production and writing. The analysis also discusses the roots of this game in the work of J. R. R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft, highlighting several points of the game like the characterisation of the races, influenced by the concepts in Tolkien’s literature and the addition of a dark element from the cosmic horror genre, introducing recognisable elements of vulnerability, horror and antagonists’ new definitions.},

  abstract = {Traditional hierarchical research methodologies and resources are exclusive because family and external stakeholders are prioritized over neurodivergent people. Unfortunately, the continued lack of inclusive design principles result in a lack of understanding of both neurodivergent culture, and the needs of the neurodivergent community. This study actively includes neurodivergent people by using participatory research methodology, and inclusive design principles and pedagogy explored in Critical Disability Studies and Critical Autism Studies. The continued pathologizing of neurodiverse conditions influences how medical systems treat neurodivergent people; Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) is the standard therapeutic treatment for autistic people. The focus of ABA and comparable treatments is to condition neurodivergent people to appear neurotypical, putting the onus on the neurodivergent community to change their behaviours instead of emphasizing acceptance and tolerance of neurodivergent people and behaviours. The statements and lived experiences of neurodivergent people who have experienced ABA showcases that it is not neurodivergent people that benefit from ABA and similar therapies, but neurotypical society that benefits from conditioning and changing the behaviours of neurodivergent folks (even if it may be at the expense of mental health and well-being). Neurodivergent self-advocacy groups, and Critical Autism scholars have expressed the need for therapies which build and encourage self-advocacy. Neurodiversity research focuses on conformity, so the unique abilities and culture of neurodivergent people is under researched. Role-play is an effective learning tool often used in therapy to help people practice skills in a low-risk environment. Role-play also is a core activity in Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRGPs) like Dungeons \& Dragons (D\&D) which allow players to explore and practice different identities and behaviours in a structured environment with more explicit rules than every day social interactions. D\&D replicates the social constructs of the real world, but does not have neurodivergence or disability as an explicit social construct in its lore. I interviewed 5 self-identifying neurodivergent adults about their lived experience, held a co-design session, and observed 15 hours of their gameplay with custom designed neurodivergent mechanics with both strengths and weaknesses. We examined the gaps in structure and consent in the core D\&D rules; the official rulebooks lack guidelines about boundary setting, consent, and facilitation for Dungeon Masters and players. Characters’ neurodivergent mechanics allowed players to more explicitly model their experience in the groups’ co-created D\&D world. This was possible because we used different TTRPG safety tools to establish boundaries which establish psychological safety that is not typically available to neurodivergent folks in everyday life. The experiences of players and their characters bled into one another. This caused players to experience positive shifts in self-esteem, and practice transferable self-autonomy skills for potential out-of-game, real life self-advocacy and liberation.},

It abstracts three types of aesthetic priorities (Creative Agendas) and four levels of analysis (Social Contract, Exploration, Techniques and Ephemera), with the former embedded in the latter and the latter affecting the former. We propose that this model provides conceptual tools that can facilitate the easy identification of problems within play sessions, and so they facilitate coming up with a possible solution; they are also useful to identify opportunities to satisfy the specific Creative Agenda shared by the group, which in turn enables a greater enjoyment (or Reward) from playing. On top of that, we propose a methodology to research the practical and experimental utility of these conceptual tools.},

  abstract = {The proposed thesis project will perform an inductive, qualitative micro-ethnography of tabletop role-playing games in at least three local contexts. The primary research method will be participant observations of these speech events over at least 100 hours of game play. Game sessions will be recorded in audio and video format so as to capture the full range of verbal and non-verbal artistry that accompanies role-playing generally. These recordings will be selectively transcribed. A web site will be constructed which will facilitate IRB and thesis committee monitoring as well as disseminate all findings. Guiding theory is arranged into the domains of Performance, Bricolage, Double-Voiced Discourse and Idioculture. I intend to challenge the idea that tabletop role-play involves a degenerative, limited type of performance. I want to explore the ways in which game participants use double-voiced discourse and strategies of persuasion during game events. I want to examine game structures such as adventures and character speech acts as if they were bricolage; are there patterns in the types of creative collages I will encounter? Considering the amount of context specific frames that role-players use and create during their games (Idioculture), my 18-year familiarity with role-playing games is an asset. This thesis project will not only extend an anthropological foothold into a relatively unexplored type of speech event, it will also significantly improve the existing body of theory which describes and explains role-playing games generally. Research will conclude with a public thesis defense in Fall 2005.},

TGNC individuals highlighted the influence of character customization, exploration, and the function of RPGs as safe spaces. In Study 2 (N = 100), we quantitatively explored the influence of RPG avatar customization on TGNC gender identity development. Although avatar customization was not associated with gender identity commitment, those playing RPGs with highly customizable avatars were more likely to report an impact of RPGs on their gender identity development. Content analyses reinforced Study 1 findings, indicating that RPGs, especially those with customizable avatars, can shape the gender identity journey for TGNC individuals.},

  abstract = {Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) have increased in popularity as a hobby and allows multiple people to play together online or in person. Group activities such as TTRPGs have been used to improve social skills and mental well-being Although there is qualitative and anecdotal studies and reports about the efficacy of the therapeutic application of TTRPGs, no related studies have employed quantitative measures or mental health screening tools. This study explored whether intentionally introduced cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered through the medium of TTRPG groups could positively affect social skills, reduce anxiety symptoms and behaviors, and enhance the mental well-being of participants. Data was collected from May 2020 to February 2021 using the Social Phobia Inventory, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Skills Inventory, and Group Satisfaction Scale and debriefs with participants. The study was completed virtually. All the groups showed an average decrease in self-reported anxiety; one of the therapeutic TTRPG groups decreased in self-reported social anxiety, while the others remained the same. All of them showed improved social skill scores and the participants were very satisfied with the overall group experience, thus suggesting that their needs were met.},

  abstract = {Quests represent an integral part of role-playing games (RPGs). While evocative, narrative-rich quests are still mostly hand-authored, player demands toward more and richer game content, as well as business requirements for continuous player engagement necessitate alternative, procedural quest generation methods. While existing methods produce mostly uninteresting, mechanical quest descriptions, recent advances in AI have brought forth generative language models with promising computational storytelling capabilities. We leverage two of the most successful transformer models, 1) GPT-2 and 2) GPT-3, to procedurally generate RPG video game quest descriptions. We gathered, processed, and openly published a dataset of 978 quests and their descriptions from six RPGs. We fine-tuned GPT-2 on this dataset with a range of optimizations informed by several ministudies. We validated the resulting Quest-GPT-2 model via an online user study involving 349 RPG players. Our results indicate that one in five quest descriptions would be deemed acceptable by a human critic, yet the variation in quality across individual quests is large. We provide recommendations on current applications of Quest-GPT-2. This is complemented by case-studies on GPT-3 to highlight the future potential of state-of-the-art natural language models for quest generation.},

  abstract = {This  work  seeks  to  present  an  analysis  of  role-playing  games  (RPGs)  from  the perspective  of  their  richness  as  didactical-pedagogical  tools.  As  such, we  endeavor to  investigate  the  ongoing  research  regarding  these  games,  as  it  is  carried  out  in Brazil,  in  order  to  achieve  a  better  understanding  of  the methodology  that  has  been applied  to  the  study  of  this  brand-new  subject  of  science. Since  we  notice  a  trend  towards  marginalization  of  role-playing  games  – an outlook  that  could  curtail  initiatives  regarding  the application  of  RPGs  to  the  teaching-learning  process – we  consider  it  necessary  to  demystify  them;  therefore, pieces  of news  disclosed  by  the  media,  implying  a  connection  between  RPGs,  crime  and magic  rituals,  are  analysed;  materials  issued  by  religious  institutions  in  which  that connection  is  punctuated  are  scrutinized  as  well.  To  grasp  this  uneasy  relationship between  role-playing  games  and  religion,  we  refer  to  Max  Weber’s  concept  of disenchantment of the world, and  by  doing  so  we  infer  the  association  of  RPGs  to scientific  thinking – an  enlightening  conclusion  that  has  enabled  us  to  understand  the conflict  between  scientific  and  religious  thinking. Besides  discussing  these  preliminary  issues,  we  identify  in  role-playing  games some  features  from  Michael  Löwy  and  Robert Sayre’s Romantic Anti-Capitalism, a perspective  that  allowed  us  to  understand  certain  traits  of  these  games,  traits  that enable  an  educative  experience  in  contradiction  with  the semi-formation  offered  by Cultural  Industry,  by  proposing  an  action  grounded  in  the  partakers’  Experience (Erfahrung), instead  of  the  typical  commodities  of  the Cultural  Industry  that  are  based in  the  viewers’  Lived Experience  (Erlebnis).  We  also  deal  with  one  of  the  subject’s  particulars  we consider  most  significant: that  role-players  might  cast  a  non-deterministic  look  upon  the  history,  because  the tale  presents  itself  open  to transformation,  and  it  is  a collective  achievement  that denaturalizes  the  social  sphere.  Finally,  we  advocate  the  possibility  of  imbuing  role-players with  a  specific habitus , one  that  spurs  them  to  actively  acquire  reading  practice  and  cultural  capital},

Our objective is to find the most important things to look for when creating one, things that we should avoid and things that we should probably add. We will take a look into a lot of open-world games that deal with the same problem as some TTRPGs and RPGs: the impossibility to know what the players will do next. We will see how they manage their races, the creation of cities and kingdoms, entire pantheons of deities and magic systems that feel integrated to the world. To accomplish that, we will make an extensive research synthesis of narrative, open world games, fantasy and worldbuilding and explore the current state of these topics regarding our topic, including an analysis of 5 open world games},

  abstract = {For several years the learning of soft skills has been underappreciated in computer science education. At the same time industry articulates the growing need for well skilled professionals that are technically equipped on one hand and good communicators and collaborators on the other hand. World wide, educational institutions adopted the suggestions from 21st century skills advise reports and started to include soft skills related topics in their curricula. This paper explains our didactic approach for engaging students into active learning for developing soft skills and to make them aware of the importance of this topic in relation to their professional future. The track ’Storytelling’ in our Game Development and Simulation program is perfectly suited for applying a didactic approach in which soft skills are naturally integrated in lectures and examination. We so do by utilising the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons. The game involves grouping students together to solve several story-driven challenges. The students have to collaborate and apply their creativity to solve these presented problems and overcome obstacles. Based on surveys from two academic semesters, we conclude that using the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons as a didactic instrument contributes to the development of students’ soft skills by offering them an engaging way of learning.},

We present a fresh perspective on interactive digital storytelling systems based on table-top role playing games. Table-top games offer players the ability to negotiate and determine outcomes of a game with a referee. The nature of table-top gaming is such that players evolve, grow and maintain a rule set that represents an imaginary world. As such this form of gameplay provides a unique opportunity to study complex interactive storytelling structures under controlled circumstances. Using table-top role playing games as a model, we propose terminology and concepts that are different from the traditional literary or dramaturgical perspectives normally applied to interactive narrative systems.},

Positive interpretation of the specified subject can serve as an additional material for further profound studying of such diverse phenomenon as reconstruction. The article purpose is to actualize the importance of the historical reconstruction, acting as an effective way of receiving new knowledge of the past of society in the context of education and upbringing of the younger generation. The source base of our research was made by a wide range of various sources: 1) the documents of the movement, including charters of clubs of historical reconstruction, the rules, the program, the regulations for running events etc.; 2) the Internet resources, presented by the websites and associations of clubs of historical reconstruction, which give the chance to expand the source base, and also to fill the niche, which was formed due to the lack of appropriate number of publications about this movement in Russia. The methodology and technique of the research is based on the principles of scientificity, the principles of dialectical connection of the cultural phenomena and processes; methods of theoretical and applied cultural science, and also the cultural and anthropological method, allowing to consider culture as the instrument of broadcast of new knowledge and practical skills in cultural and leisure domain of society. Despite the considerable amount of literature on various aspects of historical reconstruction, there is insufficiency of scientific developments on the subject of our research. At the same time, different types of reconstruction on the problems of its educational potential, gaming and cultural phenomenon have been examined by S.V. Bogdanov, N.S. Bozhk, E.M. Veselova, I.V. Glukharev, A.N. Milyukov, etc. While conducting the research, the authors have come to the conclusions that the amateur movement, including elements of the scientific direction, promotes development of interest in historical roots of people, knowledge of features of cross-cultural communication. The Internet resources, which provide the programs of numerous clubs of historical reconstruction, conducting scientific search, carrying out cultural and educational and general education work, serve as the confirmation to it. The monitoring of the concrete movement practices has shown that accumulation of knowledge of the past of society passes along most effectively in the form of thematic feasts, role-playing games of live action, show, which communicative space creates a unique opportunity to acquire new knowledge by preparation for game action. Thus, the prospects for further development of the phenomenon of historical reconstruction in getting to know the past of society consists in the analysis of various activities of participants of the movement on preservation of material and non-material cultural heritage, on reconstruction of ancient technologies under modern conditions, and also in continuous link of times, generations, traditions, providing inviolability of moral values and patriotic spirit among young people.},

Il est réalisé sur un mandat de la Bibliothèque des Jeunes (BJ) de La Chaux-de-Fonds, en association avec la Bibliothèque de la Ville de La Chaux-de-Fonds (BV). Le mandat est lié à la présence d’un fonds de livres de jeu de rôle dans les collections de la BV depuis 2012. Ce fonds n’est pas valorisé au sein des collections et peine à trouver son public. Le mandat vise à explorer la vocation, les possibilités et les contraintes d’une offre de jeu de rôle en bibliothèque de lecture publique. Il s’agit plus spécifiquement, en lien avec le mandat : • De proposer une offre de jeu de rôle cohérente avec les besoins et les contraintes exprimés par la BJ : cette offre pourra s’orienter vers un fonds comme vers des activités de jeu de rôle dans le cadre de la BJ. • De proposer des recommandations pour la valorisation et la médiation du fonds de livres de jeu de rôle de la BV. Pour ce faire, un état de l’art du jeu de rôle en bibliothèque est effectué : la place du jeu en bibliothèque, mais également le jeu de rôle en lui-même sont analysés et expliqués, grâce à une revue de la littérature et des recherches complémentaires sur différents médias et au travers d’entretiens. L’état de l’art propose un volet pratique avec la réalisation de deux enquêtes : • L’une visant à identifier les profils et les moeurs des pratiquants de jeu de rôle. Les résultats sont ensuite analysés pour établir les caractéristiques de ce public ciblé par l’offre de la BV. • L’autre visant à recueillir les retours d’expériences de bibliothèques publiques ayant mis en place une offre de jeu de rôle. Cet examen de réalisations concrètes permet d’identifier des points clés de l’élaboration d’une telle offre. Finalement, d’après les conclusions de l’état de l’art et de l’état des lieux, je proposerai des recommandations concrètes qui devront ensuite permettre aux deux bibliothèques de La Chaux-de-Fonds d’orienter leur offre liée au jeu de rôle. Il s’agira de fournir des pistes de réflexion pour orienter le fonds de la BV vers de nouveaux publics, tel que les jeunes et les familles. Ainsi le fonds pourra s’ouvrir aux publics de la BJ, et cette dernière pourra avoir un outil pour intégrer la pratique du jeu de rôle dans son activité. Je proposerai également des recommandations en lien avec la médiation du fonds, de même que l’organisation d’activités de jeu de rôle dans les deux bibliothèques pour les différents publics et selon différentes modalités.

  abstract = {El ‘storytelling’ o la narrativa, al igual que el juego, han formado parte de la civilización humana desde tiempos inmemoriales. Ambos han tenido como función ayudar al desarrollo psicológico y cultural de los participantes, así como al desarrollo de historias que transmiten una serie de creencias, valores, conocimientos y filosofías. A finales del Siglo XX, se dio origen a una transversalidad entre juegos y narrativa, cuando obras como las del afamado Tolkien, Conan el Bárbaro de Robert E. Howard y ‎Fafhrd \& the Gray Mouser de Frietz Leiber, entre otras, inspiran la creación de los primeros juegos de rol como Dungeons \& Dragons. O la obra de Anne Rice y Bram Stoker inspiraro Vampiro la Mascarada. Esta transversalidad también va en el sentido opuesto, como con el caso de Record of Lodoss War, una serie de novelas ligeras japonesas por el diseñador de juegos Ryo Mizuno, en las cuales adapto inicialmente las aventuras de su grupo de Dungeons \& Dragons, y que derivo en la creación de una franquicia que incluye juegos, anime y videojuegos. En esta transversalidad, es posible detectar tres herramientas que los juegos de rol pueden proveer al autor de novelas de género fantástico o de ciencia ficción: storytelling, worldbuilding y creación de personajes. El primer comparativo es entre las estructuras narrativas (como por ejemplo la estructura narrativa de tres arcos de Aristóteles o el ciclo de la historia de Dan Harmon) y el proceso narrativo o storytelling que sigue la planeación de una sesión o campaña de juego de rol. El segundo comparativo es entre el desarrollo del mundo la sesión o campaña de rol y el worldbuilding o creación de mundos, entre los cuales destacan las obras de Tolkien y G.R.R. Martin, así como los consejos de guías como Kobold, para darle un carácter de solidez al escenario en que la aventura se desarrolla. El tercer comparativo es entre la etapa de creación de personajes para una sesión de rol, y la creación del cast para una novela, analizando tópicos como pasado, habilidades, motivaciones, deseos, fortalezas y debilidades, que son algunos los elementos necesarios para la creación de personajes que sean atractivos para la audiencia. Esto se extiende incluso a videojuegos del tipo rol, como Final Fantasy (en particular el VI). Finalmente, se expondrá como se utilizaron estas tres herramientas del juego de rol durante el desarrollo de una serie de novelas de fantasía publicadas en 2019 y 2021. El objetivo de esta ponencia es presentar como los juegos de rol sirven como herramientas para el desarrollo de narrativas literarias de fantasía y ciencia ficción, desde la estructura de la historia, hasta la creación de personajes, pasando por la construcción de mundos detallados (mejor conocido como worldbuilding). Esto a través de comparativas con elementos de la narrativa anteriormente mencionados, como estructura de arco narrativos y de la experiencia personal de uno de los autores durante el desarrollo de dos novelas de fantasía publicadas en los pasados tres años. ENGLISH Storytelling, like play, has been part of human civilization since time immemorial. Both have had the function of helping the psychological and cultural development of the participants, as well as the development of stories that transmit a series of beliefs, values, knowledge and philosophies. At the end of the twentieth century, a transversality between games and narrative gave rise, when works such as those of the famous Tolkien, Conan the Barbarian by Robert E. Howard and Fafhrd \& the Gray Mouser by Frietz Leiber, among others, inspire the creation of the first role-playing games such as Dungeons \& Dragons. Or the work of Anne Rice and Bram Stoker inspired Vampire the Masquerade. This transversality also goes in the opposite direction, as with the case of Record of Lodoss War, a series of Japanese light novels by the game designer Ryo Mizuno, in which he initially adapted the adventures of his group of Dungeons \& Dragons, and that resulted in the creation of a franchise that includes games, anime and video games. In this transversality, it is possible to detect three tools that role-playing games can provide to the author of fantasy or science fiction novels: storytelling, worldbuilding and character creation. The first comparison is between narrative structures (e.g. Aristotle's three-arc narrative structure or Dan Harmon's story cycle) and the narrative or storytelling process that follows the planning of a role-playing game session or campaign. The second comparison is between the development of the world, the role-playing session or campaign and the worldbuilding or creation of worlds, among which the works of Tolkien and G.R.R. Martin stand out, as well as the advice of guides such as Kobold, to give a solid character to the scenario in which the adventure takes place. The third comparison is between the stage of creating characters for a role-playing session, and the creation of the cast for a novel, analyzing topics such as past, skills, motivations, desires, strengths and weaknesses, which are some of the necessary elements for the creation of characters that are attractive to the audience. This extends even to role-playing video games, such as Final Fantasy (particularly VI). Finally, it will be exposed how these three tools of the role-playing game were used during the development of a series of fantasy novels published in 2019 and 2021. The objective of this paper is to present how role-playing games serve as tools for the development of literary narratives of fantasy and science fiction, from the structure of the story, to the creation of characters, through the construction of detailed worlds (better known as worldbuilding). This through comparisons with elements of the narrative mentioned above, such as narrative arc structure and the personal experience of one of the authors during the development of two fantasy novels published in the past three years.},

  abstract = {The subject of the study is the media linguistic features of the text of a tabletop role-playing game (TRPG). The purpose of the work is to identify the essential features of the media text and answer the question: can media accompaniment of a tabletop role– playing game be considered a media text? Despite the sufficient elaboration of the topic of media communications on the Internet, the research material is a little-studied phenomenon. The research material is transcripts of sessions of the board R P G "Dungeons \& Dragons" from fragments of the T V show "Critical Role" on streaming platforms. The study examined the emergence and development of the media text concept, noting a significant expansion of this term semantics in the context of media globalization. Further, the typological properties of the media text as an object of linguistic media research were systematized and the text of the TRPG was analyzed for compliance with existing criteria. The article used descriptive and comparative methods; a statistical method to assess the popularity of the TRPG. W hen working with the transcript of the game, P ython programming methods were implemented: to increase clarity and create a correct text transcription. A s a result, conclusions were drawn about the presence of such media linguistic features in the media accompaniment of TRPG as collective authorship, hypertextuality, interactivity and etc., which constituted the scientific novelty of the study. Comparative analysis by criteria allowed us to trace qualitative changes in the typology of media texts. In addition, the expediency of expanding the terminological apparatus of media linguistics was emphasized, which correlates with the study of transmedia narration. The results of the observations can be applied to improve the text-generation that accompanies the gameplay, and can also be used to conduct similar studies based on the speech material of TRPGs.},

While autistic individuals generally dislike unpredictable situations and social interaction in larger groups, anecdotal reports suggest that they often are found in the larping community. Through interviews with 10 autistic, experienced adult larpers, this study investigates larp as a scene for social learning. The examination focuses on the attraction of larps; what the participants learn about social interaction through larping; and how such insights transfer to everyday life. From a cognitive point of view, larping comes through as an optimal autistic space where players feel safe enough to dare push their social boundaries, which conceivably contributes to the formation of more precise social predictions since experimentation and mistakes facilitate embodied learning. From the participants’ point of view, larping improved their understanding of social nuances, which in turn increased social confidence and well-being in everyday life.},

Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with two focus groups, yielding narrative data delivered by a total of nine participants. Content analysis revealed four themes that were significant to the experience of LARP players: community, creativity, play, and transformation. The data gathered regarding creativity substantiates previous studies about play and creativity, but this study offers significantly more information than is available on player experience and other topics and fills some of the current research gap in the intersectional field of adult play, creativity, and LARP.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to analyze the differences in communication affordances between offline and online variants of tabletop, or “pen \& paper” role-playing games such as Dungeons \& Dragons. The main research we will be answering is how communication affordances in these role-playing games changes in the transition from an offline social setting to an online mediated setting. Theories on layers of communication in role-playing games by Gary Allen Fine will be discussed, as will frame theory by Ervin Goffman. The methodological approach of the paper is to analyze the online role-playing platform Roll20.net and try to identify communicative affordances within the platform that may lead to a change in communication between the participants of a role-playing game. Several communicative and gameplay tools found within the online platform will be analyzed. Several of the findings lead to a possible change in communication between several of the layers the theory of Gary Allen Fine suggests. On one hand, role-playing online may lead to a more fragmented type of communication, as the computer desktop (and therefore mediated communication) acts as a barrier between players. On the other hand, the affordances within Roll20 could also lead players (who understand the inner workings of the platform) to a more streamlined game-experience, absolving the need for unnecessary and/or noisy communication. Lastly, the analysis also leads to unexpected avenues of possible follow up research. The implication on immersion in the online variant of role-playing is still up for debate, as there are both findings that would possibly suggest a more in depth and immersive role-playing experience than the offline variant, but also vice-versa. Cheating is another possibility that raises questions through this research which are still unanswered but interesting enough to follow up.},

  abstract = {My essay is premised on the observation that while canonical theories of fantastic genre fiction (fantasy, science fiction, horror) proposed by critics such as Tzetvan Todorov and Darko Suvin center on epistemic aporia, most recent examples in popular culture reject fundamental difference, alterity, and the unknown in favor of postmodern play within a limited set of generic conventions. I argue that today, tabletop roleplaying game systems (RPGs) provide a superior hermeneutic for understanding how the fantasy genre operates in mass culture than does traditional genre theory. After providing a brief overview of the historical development of fantasy gaming out of wargaming and mass market fantasy literature in the 1970s, I show how RPGs formalized fantasy’s generic tropes into a modular system that enabled participants to produce fictions across and between genres. Through a reading of Poul Anderson’s use of the “multiverse” trope in his novel Three Hearts and Three Lions, the notion that reality consists of an infinite number of interconnected worlds, I argue RPGs completed a reorientation toward the fantastic begun by mass-market fantasy literature. Epistemological concerns, distinctions between fantastic genres, and individual authorship are de-emphasized in favor of established formal conventions, a shift which encourages a participatory model of consumption and ease of transmission across diverse media. I then use the HBO adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s Game of Thrones novels as an example of how this paradigmatic shift in the fantastic has moved beyond the niche markets of fantasy fiction and roleplaying games to manifest itself today as a hegemonic cultural norm.},

  abstract = {Forest education plays a crucial role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and promoting sustainable forest management amidst global challenges. However, existing programs struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving crises and uncertainties that contribute to deforestation and forest degradation. To tackle these challenges, integrating innovative approaches into forest education is essential. This paper showcases the transformative use of a strategy game, MineSet, as an innovative teaching method for integrated forest management. The game facilitates deeply engaging experiences that provide unique insights into complex issues like deforestation. By assuming various stakeholder roles, graduate students actively engage with and confront the intricate tradeoffs inherent in forest management. This interactive and immersive role-play game not only fosters critical thinking skills but also promotes collaborative problem-solving, making MineSet a highly innovative and attractive tool in forest education. The importance of extended debriefings, facilitation throughout the game, and ongoing discussions should not be underestimated, as they establish meaningful and necessary connections between in-game events, validated educational material, and published research outcomes. Moreover, the game equips students with practical experience and a comprehensive understanding of landscape approaches, using the Congo Basin as a case study. We emphasize the potential of innovative forest education to foster sustainability, stimulate critical thinking, resolve conflicts, and prevent costly forest losses.},

Ziel der Studie war es, herauszufinden, inwiefern in den Medien gängige Vorurteile gegenüber Spielern von Pen \& Paper-Rollenspielen gerechtfertigt sind. Dafür wurden Maße für die Big Five, Risikobereitschaft, Autoritarismus und Intelligenz erhoben. Weiterhin wurden allgemeine Motive sowie Motive für das Spielen von Pen \& Paper-Rollenspielen erfasst. Die Hypothesen besagten unter Anderem, dass Spieler entgegen gängiger Vorurteile keine höhere Ausprägung auf dem Merkmal Neurotizismus zeigen würden, dass ihre Risikobereitschaft während des Spielens höher als außerhalb des Spiels sein würde und dass gemeinschaftliche Motive beim Spielen von Pen \& Paper- Rollenspielen im Vordergrund stehen würden. Mit Hilfe von t-Tests zeigte sich kein Unterschied bezüglich der Merkmale Neurotizismus und Verträglichkeit. Die Merkmale Offenheit für Erfahrungen sowie Extraversion waren bei Pen \& Paper-Rollenspielern stärker ausgeprägt als in der Vergleichsstichprobe, Gewissenhaftigkeit war schwächer ausgeprägt. Weiterhin schnitten die Spieler in einem Intelligenztest besser ab und zeigten niedrigere Werte für das Merkmal Autoritarismus. Die allgemeine Risikobereitschaft war bei Spielern niedriger ausgeprägt als bei Nicht-Spielern, dafür zeigten die Spieler eine signifikant höhere Risikobereitschaft während des Spielens von Pen \& Paper-Rollenspielen.

  abstract = {Permeated and referenced throughout popular culture, Dungeons \& Dragons has become iconic as the cardinal and archetypal tabletop role-playing game, spawning its own genre of gaming. The past forty years have seen participants drawn to the game by notions of “fun” or “enjoyment”, however as some sociologists argue, there are elements of tautology to this reasoning. While this critique may offer verity, qualitative research would suggest participant rationale is at least superficially valid, yet evokes a call to further understanding. This paper offers a preliminary analysis of the underlying motivations for playing D\&D examining concepts such as engrossment, identification, play, freedom, self-expression and various adverse affects associated with the game. Theoretically positioning Gary Alan Fine’s Shared Fantasy: Role- Playing Games as Social Worlds (1983) as the primary textual framework  underpinning this research, and juxtaposing this with a participant Internet survey (2014), this paper seeks to explore these factors, while acknowledging and maintaining the oft repeated maxim that the game is “fun”.},

  abstract = {Permeated and referenced throughout popular culture, Dungeons \& Dragons has become iconic as the cardinal and archetypal tabletop role-playing game. Participants have been drawn to D\&D for over forty years, departing into imagined and collaborative fantasy worlds. This thesis is concerned with analysing current participatory practices in D\&D, accounting for evolving styles of hybridised gaming and retentions of traditional tabletop play. It ventures beyond initial conceptual enquiries, developing tangible conclusions to the questions: “How important is the idea of community when playing Dungeons \& Dragons ?” and “What is appealing about constructing fictitious identities within the group, actualised through notions of play? ” To assist in answering these questions an Internet survey was developed. Survey data is presented, analysed, and contrasted with existing role­playing game scholarship. Emergent findings discuss participant experiences of “entertainment” “fantasy”, “community”, and preferred “ D\&D editions ”. It is strongly contended that D\&D transcends the superficialities associated with a “game”. Participants powerfully engage — transmuting participatory experiences into broader realms of purpose and meaning. The game facilitates the continual formation and negotiation of community and identity, demonstrating its wider socio­cultural applicability. The ability and appeal to engage with substantial identity exploration is clearly observable within D\&D practices. The game offers participants accessibility into divergent paradigms of reality. Participants’ playful explorations have a lasting effect in the “real world”. Finally, participants develop and enjoy a strong sense of community through their long-term gaming relationships.

(Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons). While both the organization B.A.D.D and its claims linking Role-playing games to youth suicide, drug use and Satanism eventually were discredited, the impact of these accusations lingers on to the present. This article examines the impact of the role-playing game "moral panic" on the role-playing game community and investigates the responses and coping mechanisms utilised by those directly targeted and harassed by churches, the police, schools and governments during the height of the "moral panic" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The article also investigates the effect that the shared experience of being targeted by a "moral panic" had on the formation of a role-playing counter culture and community.},

Left unexamined and uncontextualized in this discussion is the legal copyright status of Lovecraft’s original texts, which is significant since the ability to create derivative works is directly contingent upon their public domain status. This chapter surveys leading experts on the subject, such as S.T. Joshi, Chris Karr, Alex Houston and George Wetzel, in order to offer a determination of Lovecraft’s related copyrights based on their research, while also detailing how the decline of Arkham House’s legal authority on the matter as a self-espoused holder of exclusive rights provided an opportunity to those small creators without resources to generate their own works. The lack of a strong monopoly holder of Lovecraft’s copyrights directly contributed to an organic growth of Lovecraft derivative works that was not contingent on the approval, funding or encouragement of a central organization, and thus the cultural activities surrounding the works were characterized by the artists’ direct relationship to the texts, rather than the interference and agency of a central rights holder.},

Evangelical gamers, have to negotiate criticisms and carve out a social space for themselves among their fellow-believers as Christians who play RPGs. The chapter explores both the strategies used to maintain them and the potential dissonances and ambivalences that they engender. It is divided into two main sections. In the first, the author presents a brief overview of the evangelical critique of role-playing games (RPGs) that emerged in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Secondly, following on from this, he draws on a range of primary materials and interviews with gamers themselves to examine the ways in which evangelical Christian gamers attempt to both respond to these critiques and create a specifically Christian space within the role-playing community.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in the use of games to scaffold social skills training for autistic children and youth. However, there is no consensus on how to best approach their design, so that learning opportunities are maximised. This article presents a systematic scoping review of empirical studies that use games as social skills training for autistic children and youth. We set out to describe the different types of game-based interventions observed, to identify those that typically bring successful outcomes (while noting the social skills targeted in each), and to highlight the psychological intervention approach taken. Through a search of five databases, 3070 studies were identified and reduced, through screening, to a sample of 17 studies. Each study reported that their game successfully promoted social skills training for autistic people. Although not a part of the criteria, all studies included a technological element. However, across the sample, there was also a lack of specificity in how ‘social skills’ were defined and in which skills were chosen as the focus of the intervention. Moving forward, we recommend a more theoretically driven approach to defining behavioral targets for game-based interventions, as well as the inclusion of autistic voices earlier and more centrally in the design processes. Lay Abstract There is growing interest in using games to help autistic children and youth learn social skills. However, there is no clear agreement on the best way to design these games to ensure they are most effective. In our research, we reviewed studies that used games to teach social skills to autistic children and youth. We aimed to describe the different types of games, identify which ones were most successful and understand the psychological methods used. We searched five databases and found 3070 studies, which we narrowed down to 17 that met our criteria. Each of these 17 studies reported that their game helped improve social skills in autistic children. Interestingly, all these studies used some form of technology, even though this was not a requirement. However, we noticed that many studies were not clear on what specific social skills they were targeting or how they defined ‘social skills’. For future work, we suggest that game-based interventions should be more clearly based on established theories. In addition, it is important to involve autistic people in the design of these games to ensure they meet their needs effectively.},

However, there is little research that establishes, from a psychosocial perspective, how playing D\&amp;D provides opportunities for supporting frequent player’s mental health. Using semi-structured interviews and a reflexive thematic analysis, we aimed to understand better how playing D\&amp;D interacted with players’ well-being psychologically and socially, as well as exploring factors that may prove challenging or problematic in the therapeutic context. 6 men, 2 women, and 2 nonbinary people participated in the study. Analysis illustrated several processes that are supportive for players’ mental health. These features were identified as five key themes: escapism, exploration of self, creative expression, social support, and routine. These findings highlight the transformative potential of D\&amp;D in a therapeutic setting, offering insights into its positive impact.},

  abstract = {Despite growing recognition of the potential benefits of video games, the positive psychological impact of narrative role-playing games (RPGs) remains understudied. These games, with their immersive storytelling, are uniquely positioned to foster meaningful engagement. However, known protective factors for well-being such as positive emotions and character interactions-otherwise known as parasocial interactions-have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this gap, this study employed a mixed-methods approach to investigate the design elements underlying positive emotions and meaningful parasocial interactions in narrative RPGs, combining an online questionnaire with open-and closed-ended questions completed by 100 participants and in-depth interviews with 10 individuals. Linear regression analyses demonstrated reciprocal predictive relationships between positive affect and parasocial interactions as well as positive affect and negative affect. Additionally, reflexive thematic analysis generated six themes that captured how players experienced these effects in narrative RPGs, ranging from the freedom of immersion to narrative soundness. Based on these insights, a set of research-informed recommendations targeted towards optimising player well-being was produced for developers of this genre. Overall, it is suggested that narrative-gameplay consistency, fantasy-reality balance, and negative but meaningful experiences stimulate positive emotions and meaningful parasocial interactions in narrative RPGs, providing implications for the future research, design, and evaluation of this genre.},

  abstract = {The third book in a multivolume series dedicated to the critical study of the virtual worlds of video game narrative and story. Third Person examines vast narratives across diverse media ranging from comic books to television and video games to literature. Electronic games have established a huge international market, significantly outselling non-digital games; people spend more money on The Sims than on "Monopoly" or even on "Magic: the Gathering." Yet it is widely believed that the market for electronic literature -- predicted by some to be the future of the written word -- languishes. Even bestselling author Stephen King achieved disappointing results with his online publication of "Riding the Bullet" and "The Plant." Isn't it possible, though, that many hugely successful computer games -- those that depend on or at least utilize storytelling conventions of narrative, character, and theme -- can be seen as examples of electronic literature? And isn't it likely that the truly significant new forms of electronic literature will prove to be (like games) so deeply interactive and procedural that it would be impossible to present them as paper-like "e-books"? The editors of First Person have gathered a remarkably diverse group of new media theorists and practitioners to consider the relationship between "story" and "game," as well as the new kinds of artistic creation (literary, performative, playful) that have become possible in the digital environment. This landmark collection is organized as a series of discussions among creators and theorists; each section includes three presentations, with each presentation followed by two responses. Topics considered range from "Cyberdrama" to "Ludology" (the study of games), to "The Pixel/The Line" to "Beyond Chat." The conversational structure inspired contributors to revise, update, and expand their presentations as they prepared them for the book, and the panel discussions have overflowed into a First Person web site (created in conjunction with the online journal Electronic Book Review).},

  abstract = {The purpose of the research presented in this work is the evaluation of Neural Machine Translation systems: Chat GPT, Google Translate, and DeepL Translate, based on the translation of a fragment of "Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen" from English to Polish language. The work begins by presenting the subject matter – the Neural Machine Translation technology, its history, evolution and way of functioning. Its inclusion in the modern world is introduced, along with its challenges. The three target systems of analysis are described: Chat GPT, Google Translate and DeepL Translate. Following the introduction of the technology, the matter of error categorisation is touched upon, along with the methodologies that can be employed in order to analyse them. A hybrid methodology is chosen for the main analysis of this work. In the last section of the thesis, the reader is familiarised with the background of the "Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen" text. Next, the analysis is conducted. It is based on selected fragments of the three Neural Machine Translation systems' translations. In the process, errors are described and categorised. In the conclusion of the work, the gathered data is summarised, and appropriate conclusions are drawn and described. The original text is included in the Appendices section, along with the reference human translation and three Neural Machine Translators' output texts.},

  abstract = {In fantasy role-playing games, participants collectively create and play fantasy personas in an imaginary universe by using a vast system of rules that function as guidelines for make-believe action and interaction. Consequently, role-playing games obligate participants to occupy a liminal role located in the boundaries of persona, player, and person. This study, based on approximately ninety hours of participant observation and forty interviews with thirty role-players, explores how role-players actively negotiate these symbolic boundaries: how role-players carve out distinct spheres of meaning between themselves, their fantasy personas, and status as players of these games. It also illustrates how these distinctions fail. Boundaries erupt and role-players prove unable to compartmentalize themselves so discretely. Through the lens of these games, we can examine simplified and exaggerated dynamics and entertain the possibility that we are all players located at the liminal margins between the people we believe ourselves to be and the personas we perform in situated social encounters.},

  abstract = {Since tabletop fantasy role-playing games emerged in the 1970s, fantasy gaming has made a unique contribution to popular culture and perceptions of social realities in America and around the world. This contribution is increasingly apparent as the gaming industry has diversified with the addition of collectible strategy games and other innovative products, as well as the recent advancements in videogame technology.    This book presents the most current research in fantasy games and examines the cultural and constructionist dimensions of fantasy gaming as a leisure activity. Each chapter investigates some social or behavioral aspect of fantasy gaming and provides insight into the cultural, linguistic, sociological, and psychological impact of games on both the individual and society. Section I discusses the intersection of fantasy and real-world scenarios and how the construction of a fantasy world is dialectically related to the construction of a gamer's social reality. Because the basic premise of fantasy gaming is the assumption of virtual identities, Section II looks at the relationship between gaming and various aspects of identity. The third and final section examines what the personal experiences of gamers can tell us about how humans experience reality.},

A substantial body of literature has been produced regarding the application of TTRPGs within the context of therapy, as an activity promoting psychological development and improved mental health. This hermeneutic study examines TTRPGs through a depth psychological framework and explores a gap in the literature, inquiring specifically about what archetypal and imaginal psychology can reveal about their psychotherapeutic value. The analysis that follows deconstructs previous suggestions made in the literature that TTRPGs benefit individuals via interpretation and subsequent interventions. The findings of this study indicate that TTRPGs serve a therapeutic function by ritualizing participation with fantasy-images that instantiate mythological narratives, thereby facilitating reflective insight on and observation of underlying psychological processes. Recommendations are suggested for further investigation of the concepts explored in this study pertaining to specific populations that may benefit from nontraditional approaches to psychotherapy.},

  abstract = {Tabletop ‘pen and paper’ role-play games (TTRPGs) can function as spaces of creative experimentation with gender identity through shared storytelling. The last decade has seen an explosion of Actual Play (AP) shows that broadcast recorded gameplay of TTRPGs to online audiences. Neverafter is the 15th season of well-known AP show Dimension 20 and is a horror-themed re-imagining of classic fairy tales through the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. Four of the six player characters are male, based individually on the fairy tales of Pinocchio, Puss in Boots, the Frog Prince, and a (gender-swapped) Mother Goose, adventuring together in a story-world called ‘The Neverafter’. Not only are these versions of the fairy tale characters shaped by the players' own explorations of identity, but as an AP show, this is also layered with the expectations produced by the show's wide fan base. Their diverse gender explorations and their subversion of fairy tale conventions are enabled by the fluency of the players and audience in freely flowing between the framing perspectives of player and character. This chapter will focus on non-binary player Ally Beardsley's creation and performance of Mother Timothy Goose as a gay, elderly, human man as a particularly meaningful case study. This analysis considers how heroic masculinity is reconceptualised in Neverafter through the horror-themed embodiment of fairy tale men in the context of contemporary gender issues.},

The “Drachenfest” as a unique and challenging environment called for the implementation of something not yet described in earlier research about social safety. This paper will detail the implementation of a social safety team as a best practice example. It will consider questions of how to put such a team together and how to write an accompanying code of conduct. The paper also describes standard procedures for the work of such a team. The team performed admirably but still offered valuable lessons for improvement. The paper seeks to illustrate these lessons to strengthen attempts at implementing social safety teams at other events.},

This article focuses on tabletop role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons to show how play cultures in Singapore are shaped by transmedia storytelling techniques. In doing so, it makes two contributions to existing research: first, it shifts scholarly focus from game texts to player practice, showing how communities of play are created through players’ emergent usage of transmedia storytelling techniques. Second, it describes a player practice of soft canon, which I theorise as an approach to shared world-making that prioritises the emotional resonance of narrative details over a positivist accounting of narrative events. The concept of soft canon reveals a new perspective on how communities create and sustain intersubjectively imagined worlds.},

This change in definitions calls into question whether pieces of media not previously considered “theatre” could now be identified as such. This research will be a case study of the Dungeons \& Dragons web show, Critical Role, to evaluate whether it, and by extension web shows like it, could be considered theatre. Specifically, the research will focus on Critical Role’s ongoing 2nd campaign, “The Mighty Nein”. It has been airing live on Thursday nights since January 11th, 2018 and features a main cast of eight professional voice actors. I will compare Critical Role to the digital theatre shows commissioned and performed by the University Players in the fall of 2020 to see what theatrical elements they have in common. I will also look at Stanislavski’s “magic if” realist acting technique and how it is used in the improvisation and chance gameplay inherent in the Dungeons \& Dragons format. By classifying Critical Role as theatre, perhaps more digital content can be categorized and studied as pieces of theatre in the future.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been an increasing push for foreign language teachers to use a communicative approach to language instruction. One area this can be seen is through role-plays, activities where students take on a persona other than themselves to complete a task in the target language. Despite the growing popularity of role-play, there has been little empirical research looking at the impact of role-play on students. In particular, the differences between large group and small group role-plays remain virtually unstudied.  This thesis looks at role-play in Chinese language classrooms from the perspectives of both teachers and students. To obtain the teacher perspective educators throughout Massachusetts were surveyed about their attitudes and approach to using role-play. To better understand student attitudes towards role-play, a wide variety of role-plays were observed and data was collected from the participants.  Observations of over fifty role-plays showed that large group role-plays have a wide variety of benefits including: increasing student enjoyment, providing more opportunities for peer learning/teaching, and enabling teachers to give more immediate feedback. These implications as well as other suggestions for how to successfully use role-play in the language classroom are explored more fully later in the thesis. In order to make role-play more accessible to foreign language teachers, a series of role-play lesson plans based on the principles discussed are also provided in the appendix.},

  abstract = {As with any educational modality, no guarantees can be made about efficacy and consistency across student populations. Therefore, when we discuss didactics and RPGs, we refer to their potential. Because RPGs are a form of experiential learning, within which players interact with each other in shared co-creativity, our experience and research indicates that their didactic potential is heightened, particularly along specific cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions (Bowman 2014). Additionally, because RPGs are multimodal, meaning they have multiple methods of engagement operating at the same time, students have the possibility to train several skills and practice working with multiple bases of knowledge at once. Notably, this strength of RPGs can also be considered a weakness depending on the context. RPGs are often far more chaotic than typical classroom activities, as each student is granted more agency to make meaningful choices than is usually permitted in educational settings. Sometimes, teachers may feel out of control or ill-equipped to handle this comparatively chaotic energy (Larsson 2004, p. 247; Harder 2007, p. 234; Hyltoft 2010, p. 51). Additionally, RPGs’ multimodal nature often means that students are engaging in multiple activities at the same time, with their associated thought processes and emotional reactions. Thus, a challenge for educational RPG designers and facilitators is in finding ways to make sure the activity centers upon the specific learning objective and/or curricular goals. Additionally, educators should be aware of some of the central concepts in both role-playing theory and in didactics in order to make informed choices in the classroom. This chapter will explain some of the key concepts in these areas, applying them to learning situations involving RPGs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To find out if there is a difference in what is perceived about learning depending on your relation to edularp. Theory: Hammer at al’s (2018) model of educational features of role-playing. The model consists of five main features that each has a number of sub parts. The five main features are Portraying a character, Manipulation a fictional world, Altered sense of reality, Shared imagination, and Making RPGs. The feature Making RPGs is not used since it is not relevant for this study. Method: Using a pre-existing quantitive survey and making qualitative interviews with edularp participants. The four interviewees have different relations to edularp. Two are student participants, one is a teacher and one is a designer. The data are analysed with Hammer at al’s (2018) model to see what features each participant see and if they see anything that is not covered by the model. Result: In the end there does not seem to be any clear differences in perceptions about learning from edularps regardless if you are a student, a teacher or a designer. What seems to affect most is more connected to how immersed you are in the larp rather than what relationship you have to it. There do seem to be a difference between what parts that were easy or hard to perceive. When applying Hammer et al's (2018) key features about learning through RPGs and edularps to the experience of participants we can see that some learning features in edularps are easier perceived than others. Two areas were found that after further research might be relevant to ad to Hammer at al’s (2018) model, Agency and Personal growth.},

  abstract = {In traditional drama, an audience watches a story presented by characters on a stage. Interactive Drama changes the audience to a single User who enters that stage, interacting with the characters, and participating in the story. Computer-based interactive drama allows a User to interact with simulated worlds which are inhabited by dynamic and complex autonomous characters and shaped by a flexible, aesthetically pleasing story. Unlike the actions of characters in a play, the actions of the User are not controlled by the artist. The problem is to shape the User's experience to conform to the set of themes and ideas to be conveyed. This work proposes this problem can be solved by dynamically monitoring and subtly guiding the experience of the User. This dissertation describes an architecture called Moe that is designed to provide dramatic guidance. Moe uses abstract, adversary search with an aesthetic evaluation function to decide how and when to guide the User's experience. The first technical achievement of this work is a demonstration of the ability to capture a dramatic aesthetic (for one interactive drama) in an automated evaluation function that can examine an experience and determine its quality, much as a movie critic determines the quality of a film. This result is supported by statistically demonstrating a high degree of correlation (r =.87) between the evaluation function and the human artist. The second main technical achievement of this work is the implementation of three such strategies (SAS and SAS+, both based on random sampling; and MMFC, which uses memoization to implement a full-depth search) and a search state that seem capable of effectively modelling and guiding an interactive dramatic experience. Moe has not yet been connected to a running interactive experience, but instead Moe has been tested with a variety of Simulated User Types. On "average" Users, SAS, SAS+, and MMFC are able to improve Users' experiences from the 50th percentile, to the 94th, 98th, and 99th percentile, respectively. This is a large and artistically meaningful increase. This dissertation describes the first implementation of a system designed to provide centralized dramatic guidance in an interactive drama.},

It shows how the conversation inside the hobby sought to establish what a role-playing game was or should be, accompanied by a conversation in the mass media that framed role-playing as an activity for youth and made either condescending or alarmist normative judgments about those who engaged in it. It offers those conversations as the context in which two seminal essays written by a tabletop RPG (TRPG) designer named Ron Edwards served as the impetus for the Forge as a place to pursue the internal discourse—in other words, as a place to take role-playing games seriously.},

  abstract = {The idea of player safety – a concern for the psychological well-being of the people who play role-playing games on the part of those who design and run those games – has within the past several years emerged as a rubric for a whole host of pre-game, in-game, and post-game procedures intended to address that concern, particularly in larp but in tabletop RPGs as well. However, considerations of player safety sometimes produce skeptical responses on the part of those who fear, for instance, that player safety mechanisms will somehow dilute the experience or stifle their creativity. Examining the dynamics of conversations produced by these countervailing concerns can provide insight into the nature of RPG participation. A full understanding of these dynamics, however, will benefit from an investigation of the historical underpinnings of the discourse of player safety. To that end, this essay explores conversations around safety-related discourse within the online sphere known as the “Forge Diaspora.” The Forge was an online discussion site for tabletop RPG design, publication, and play that was active in the first decade of the twenty-first century, serving to champion creator-owned “indie RPGs” and game design innovation during that period. In addition, it inspired a panoply of blogs and forums where further discussion took place. Among the considerations related to player safety discussed within the Forge Diaspora were the tools Ron Edwards called Lines and Veils and Meguey Baker’s complementary principles of Nobody Gets Hurt and I Will Not Abandon You. This essay uses techniques of rhetorical analysis to reconstruct frameworks of narrative and argumentation about these and related ideas with the goal of providing historical context for contemporaneous conversations about player safety.},

It describes some of the arguments about GNS that were raised, and describes how GNS fits into the broader ‘Big Model’ of Forge theory as ‘Creative Agenda’ (CA) that functioned as potential orienting principles for a given play group. It presents the Big Model as a kind of frame-analytic approach to understanding the structure of TRPG activity, and suggests that within such an approach, CA serve the useful purpose of allowing that activity to be understood as play. It also discusses the experience of Forge participants in grappling with the Big Model.},

  abstract = {This paper examines video recordings of a panel presentation by game designers Ron Edwards of the United States and Tobias Wrigstad of Sweden at an Italian gaming convention in May 2010. The paper uses a dramatistic perspective to explore the discursive dynamics of their encounter, which represented contact between role-playing game designers from different traditions that were driven by similar imperatives and goals. It establishes the context of their encounter, summarizes the video recordings that document it, and uses the “dramatistic pentad” developed by rhetorician Kenneth Burke as a tool for reading the multiple levels of narrative and interaction that emerge as each speaker presents their perspective on the development of the different communities of play for whom they speak. It identifies an important dynamic within their speech as being how orientations toward differentiation or toward integration manifest in different ways. Ultimately, the encounter between Ron Edwards and Tobias Wrigstad provides access to different ways of thinking about the relationships between role-playing communities over time and in space: as instances of differentiation or as parts of a larger dialogue.},

Research was centred around the question: to what extent has the non-institutionalized use of Role-Playing Games affected students' academic engagement and self-efficacy? This research was undertaken in order to investigate potential uses of the Role-Playing Game as an instructional tool. Mixed-methods research was employed, involving surveys regarding the amount of games played, student interviews, and teacher interviews. It was found that RPG use and self-efficacy were significantly positively correlated, RPG use and academic engagement were weakly to moderately negatively correlated, and that RPG use did not significantly impact the desire to learn. Recurring responses to interviews cited interactivity and ownership of narrative as factors contributing to RPG use by students.},

So the idea of immersion is central to understanding how Dungeons Dragons and other aspects of participatory culture work. Phenomenology is a kind of “philosophy of mind” associated with the works of twentieth-century philosophers Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, among others. The domain of phenomenology encompasses the entire range of experiences in the world, paying attention to what Husserl called “intentionality,” or how our consciousness is directed toward particular objects in the world. The fact that this is presented as an atypical approach to play, or at least one that requires some effort, invites us to ask about typical modes of play if visualization of in-game events is not that mode. This chapter concluded by scratch the surface of a complete phenomenological description of role-playing.},

As the game begins, the imminent arrival of the Sun is announced, and game-play is about how the  people of this culture deal with the approaching dawn. In one such game, the players of three male  characters went through interesting character arcs in their interactions with each other and with female players; those arcs seemed to depict movement among different models of masculine identity. One implication of the study is that RPGs afford a fruitful site for reflecting upon ideas in discourse,  and so it is possible for role-playing to serve as an aesthetic as well as an expressive medium—as art as well as play, in other words.},

  abstract = {Design courses commonly discuss the importance of the voice of the customer and the voice of the product in the design process but the voice of the designer is often absent from the process. This is in contrast to the way that the vision and creativity of famous designers (e.g. Steve Jobs, Burt Rutan, Dean Kamen, etc.) are admired and celebrated. How do we help students to develop their creativity and incorporate their voice into the process? How can we also help them to improve the quality of the ideas that they inject into the design process? A course in creativity and creativity techniques was developed as a prototype to test creativity teaching techniques for subsequent incorporation into a capstone design sequence. The primary creativity mechanism was to utilize art both as a prism for new ways of seeing and as a vehicle to explore design in collaboration with the Barnes Foundation of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Students in this course explored techniques to help them find their creative core and ways to use art as a prism to see engineering design from multiple perspectives. To achieve these learning goals and to free students from potential self-limiting behaviors in discussing non-technical matters, role-playing as part of a popular role-playing game was utilized to enable students to approach creativity and creativity techniques from their character's perspective. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.},

  abstract = {Though tabletop role-playing games, or TRPGs, have received some scholarly attention since the creation of Dungeons and Dragons in the 1970s, very few scholars have considered how TRPGs function as a vehicle for long-form narrative. As an inherently collaborative form of narrative, the TRPG demonstrates a unique relationship between author and audience, as participants take on both roles during play. Previous narratological models of author-audience interaction are insufficient to understand the way that authorship functions in the TRPG, and the rise of actual play shows, where TRPGs are broadcast for an audience of nonparticipants, adds an extra layer of complexity to these author-audience relations. This thesis identifies key narrative elements of the TRPG, including game mechanics, framing, and collaboration, and examines how popular actual play shows and their graphic adaptations engage with these elements to create their narratives. This examination indicates that TRPGs create complex author-webs where each participant is both author and audience, and this influence pushes actual play shows and further adaptations of TRPG narratives to expand the ways in which audiences can influence and interact with narratives as they are created. The TRPG genre continues to explore how these elements can be developed beyond traditional understandings of narrative, and this development provides a framework for further narratological study of interactive works, which will only continue to evolve and grow in popularity and complexity in the continuing digital era.},

Drawing on unobtrusive behavioral data captured by the game, combined with a large survey and traditional ethnographic methods, the study found that role players both negotiate identity and use their time online as a moratorium for their offline lives. Descriptive results showed that role players are a relatively small, but psycholo- gically burdened subgroup. When examined from the theoretical perspectives of Goffman’s Self-Presentation theory, Huizenga’s Magic Circle, and Turkle’s early work on online identity formation, these players were seen as largely using virtual spaces as creative outlets and for socialization. The worlds also functioned as coping mechanisms for players frequently unable to gain acceptance, social connectivity or social support offline due to their personal situation, psychological profile, or their minority status.},

  abstract = {Moral panics around youth entertainment have been an occurrence as long as culture has been established. As long as youth entertainment has values that can be seen as going against the established values of the preceding generation, a moral panic could take place. The purpose of this research was to analyze how moral panics centered on youth entertainment begin and gain traction. To do this, the research was focused on the 1980s moral panic around tabletop roleplaying games, specifically Dungeons \& Dragons. By tracing the origin of the moral panic to the fear of cults and occult from the 1970s, we can find more context as to why some individuals believed that role playing games could cause adolescents to use the games as a style of dangerous escapism or as a gateway to the occult. To further understand this moral panic, an analysis of some of the major detractors of role playing games was done, as well as researching the role the media played in cultivating the moral panic. With a greater understanding on how moral panics begin and gain traction, this research can be used to compare and contrast other moral panics around youth entertainment.},

  abstract = {Miniatures wargaming is big business, with the Warhammer series of games, made by Games Workshop, pulling in revenues which rival Dungeons \& Dragons. Yet they remain underexamined. This is changing, with videos and books about the history of the form proliferating in recent years. In this talk, Ian Williams will chart the history of miniatures as a cultural form. Where did miniatures wargaming start? How are they made and why do the games play the way they do? What’s the difference between a historical wargame and fantasy/sci-fi? How did Games Workshop come to dominate the industry? What commentary do they offer on the broader culture? Why are we watching Duncan Rhodes on YouTube to learn how to paint? And why are there so many Space Marines in Games Workshop’s catalogue? Ian Williams has been a DJ, game designer, labor reporter, and pro wrestling historian. Prior to pursuing his PhD, he was a featured weekly columnist at VICE Sports, and his writing on digital labor and other topics can be found at Jacobin, VICE, Paste, The Guardian, and quite a few others. Ian’s research interests concern the connections between design, mass production, and craft movements. He examines both the labor conditions under which these activities occur and the communities which spring up around them. His prospective dissertation is in an examination of the material history of miniatures wargaming, both as a matter of political economy and how they are used to rhetorically imagine history.

It aims at interpretivist and constructionist approaches to RPGs, focusing first on important concepts such as interaction, identity, role, and frames to then broaden focus to culture as discuss player relations, collaborative action, and rationality. The chapter presents social stratification research that highlights noteworthy trends related to class, education, religion, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity in RPGs from a realist perspective. Sociologists often study players' experiences and behaviors in and around RPGs. This has to do with what many see as inherently attractive about RPGs – the interactive environments within which groups can collaboratively construct an imagined world and then act in it. RPGs facilitate many different player configurations and types of social interaction. In sociology, "race" refers to dividing humans by observable physical characteristics like skin color, while "ethnicity" refers to dividing humans by culture.},

The chapter begins with processes at the micro-level, demonstrating how interpretivist and constructionist approaches to sociological inquiry foreground player experiences and meaning-making. Concepts such as situation, identity, role, and frame help explain how players develop the shared understandings necessary for successful gameplay. The chapter then broadens to focus on culture and social organization at the meso-level. RPGs facilitate many different types of player relations and social interactions, such as TRPG gaming communities attending conventions or the complex, collaborative play illustrated by MMORPG group play. Finally, the chapter shifts to a more positivist approach and zooms out to the macro-level to review social stratification research highlighting noteworthy trends related to the RPG player base, gender and sexuality, and race and ethnicity. RPGs are now global phenomena shaped by mainstream cultures and societies in which they are produced and consumed, but which also (re)produce and (re)shape cultures and societies through player practices and representations. Sociology is well-positioned to study all these dimensions of role-playing and games.},

The mean MBTI scores were compared with the national averages using a one-sample t-test analysis. The participants reported personality types involving significantly more introversion, t(49) = -4.07, p {$<$} 0.001; more intuition, t(49) = -5.69, p {$<$} .001; and more perception, t(49) = -2.36, p {$<$} .05, than the reported national averages (all tests two-tailed). The sample did not differ significantly in terms of thinking versus feeling functions. With the SPS and DDQ each having a potential range of 1-6, participants found the traits of increased strategy (M = 5.82), imagination development (M = 5.32), creation and maintenance of friendships (M = 5.26) and expression of alter egos (M = 5.78) to be influenced and facilitated by D \& D. Participants also scored significantly in the categories of spirituality’s importance on meaning of life (M = 5.26) and influence on one’s life (M = 5.4) showing a correlation between D \& D and spirituality.},

As an overview of video game vampires, the chapter outlines the inclusion of fantasy vampires in early role-playing-games and demonstrates how from a hierarchical position, the ludic and narrative qualities that the vampires engender have become increasingly sophisticated and unique to the medium. The chapter then considers formations of the video game vampire as a distinct product of vampire franchising, to discuss how external licenses from other media forms have been utilized with varying degrees of success. In comparison to the strategic marketing of the vampire, the chapter goes on to explore two key examples of video game vampires and sexuality, to show how cultural media formations and discourses have shaped their relationship to the vampire text over time. The chapter concludes with an overview of the modern vampire, to show how they differ from the fantasy vampire in their overt replication of contemporary social structures and in their production, engage with equally modern industrial practices.},

Looking at campaigns from two YouTube series, Critical Role and High Rollers, I identify the network of interactions required by the performers, including “in-character” performances, “out of character” interactions, and liminal components of the game, such as rolling dice to determine in-game events. After establishing the boundaries of these mental spaces, I focus on instances where these spaces blend, such as pop culture references being used in-game, to demonstrate the necessity of a Discourse Viewpoint Space, a “higher-level discourse space” within which multiple viewpoints can be reconciled (Dancygier \& Vandelanotte 2017, p. 570). Understanding the flow of multiple discourse spaces in a setting such as a role-playing game is driven by complex viewpoint networks, and can partly be identified through the features of speech (such as using an accent when in character). By focusing on instances of unexpected merging of character and player, my paper analyzes the means by which players integrate multiple viewpoints when playing D\&D, and how this integration is necessary to strengthen what Banks et al. (2018) refer to as player-avatar relationships.},

  abstract = {Background This study explores the emotional experiences of players in online, text-based tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) and their potential impact on players. The goal is to understand the therapeutic and educational possibilities arising from these emotional experiences. Methods Through qualitative analysis, themes were identified based on participants' narratives. Eight participants who engaged in online, text-based TTRPGs were interviewed to gather data on their emotional experiences and effects outside the game. Result The study identified three main categories of emotions experienced by players: emotions related to the community, emotions associated with the game world and characters, and emotions linked to game mechanics. These emotions were found to impact players beyond the gaming environment, influenced by the players' emotional immersion. Additionally, the study revealed two distinct approaches to immersion among players and highlighted emotions as motivating factors for gameplay. Discussion The findings emphasize the role of TTRPGs in providing creative outlets, social interaction, and recreation, facilitating skill development, and broadening perspectives based on players' emotional experiences. Additionally, this study highlights the potential for immersion in online, text-based TTRPGs linked to therapeutic and educational uses. Limitations This study employs an in-depth phenomenological qualitative interview method. While this approach yields detailed and nuanced data, it may not provide extensive generalizability. Future research endeavors could benefit from more significant and diverse participant pools to enhance the understanding of emotional experiences in TTRPG players. Furthermore, exploring additional factors such as genres, narrative structures, and player-character relationships could offer more profound insights. Conclusion This study demonstrates that online, text-based TTRPGs allow players to experience various emotions with implications beyond the game's boundaries. The findings suggest that interventions based on role-playing activities may benefit from the online text-based method due to its accessibility and lower barriers to entry.},

  abstract = {The life story of Gary Gygax, godfather of all fantasy adventure games, has been told only in bits and pieces. Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008. Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons \& Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D\&D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered. Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D\&D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Told in narrative-driven and dramatic fashion, Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the rules and rulebooks of original Dungeons \& Dragons, and Dungeons \& Dragons fifth edition to look at how the game uses characterization during the character creation process. The first chapter examines the origins of D\&D by looking closer at rules in the pamphlets written by Gary Gygax and some of the games’ supplements like published through The Dragon magazine. The characterization rules used in original D\&D can be recognized as characterization by role, a term used by Uri Margolin in his theory of character. This type of characterization can be seen in literature inspired by the game, as seen in Quag Keep by Andre Norton. The author uses many of the rules provided by the game, and further builds on the problematic aspects of the game like misogyny and racist systems. The second chapter examines the overarching narrative in the core rulebooks of Dungeons \& Dragons fifth edition. I argue that this narrative has connections to stereotypes, clichés, and tropes found in the genre of sword and sorcery, and that this narrative is forced onto the players as the main world of D\&D. This limits the narrative freedom of the players, and authors who decide to write novels in the general world of D\&D as seen in the novels Vox Machina: Kith \& Kin by Marieke Nijkamp, and Legends \& Lattes by Travis Baldree. I argue that the limitations of narrative freedom spill over to culture around by embracing some of the general tropes of D\&D as well as concepts racial hierarchy.},

This journey is approached through an investigation in and with the participatory arts exploring moments of dance, sensory movement, meditation, play, deep listening and mythmaking.

I aim to spark a conversation within the practice of design ab- out new forms of world-building, language-building and relationship-building through play, for the significance of this research lies in its recognition of playfulness and collective story-making as a catalyst for change.

  abstract = {Play and learning have always been closely interrelated ideas, with games historically being utilized as social constructs that are simultaneously pedagogical and entertaining in intent. This dissertation will examine an underappreciated element of gaming's pedagogical history through thinking about English composition education as a kind of gaming. Whereas much recent research about gaming has focused on the promises of digital games, I will focus on an older and more fluid type of gaming represented by Tabletop Role Playing Games. In the modern day, Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs), like the well-known game Dungeons \& Dragons, represent a combination of traditional and innovative play that foreshadows where and how educators might make use of play-based learning. In my first chapter, I will present the evolution and history of TRPGs from strategic wargaming into a higher and more complex form of general interactive simulation and gameplay. In so doing, I will demonstrate that games and play are an inherently educational form of activity, and have always been so in almost every manifestation. In my second chapter, I take a closer look at gameplay, and what makes it motivational, social, and effective as a form of pedagogy that could be readily incorporated into the classroom. I highlight the three most pertinent advantages which TRPGs can offer to modern students and educators: the harnessing of student engagement, the encouraging of role-play and personal agency-driven learning, and the creation of authentic contexts within which learning may take place. In my third chapter, I offer the composition classroom as a perfect example of a learning context wherein game-based learning can be of use to students and educators. I note the ways in which TRPGs benefit compositional learning, particularly in the case of the First-Year Writing and genre-based composition courses in higher education. In my fourth chapter, I present a model for introducing TRPGs into the composition classroom, using The Quiet Year as a structural example for a First-Year Writing course activity. I conclude by describing my own experiences running TRPGs in educational environments, and the benefits which such a game-based approach can offer.},

And how can education scholars engage sound within posthuman research? Through a posthuman framework, we position noise as an analytical tool for exploring and unveiling more-than-human relations. We then draw parallels between posthuman qualitative research into sound (via noise) and the ideological foundation of experimental music, a musical tradition deeply invested in working with sound as an agentic actor. Within this alignment, we propose using graphic scores to transcribe sonic data without reinscribing humanist research aims. To illustrate, we provide a micro-analysis of preservice teachers engaged in a role-playing game activity and uncover the ways sound asserts its agency within learning ecologies.},

First released in 1974, D\&D remains the most popular and globally successful RPG franchise. Although developed as a tabletop game where players sit at a table, rolling dice and sketching maps on paper, the game is is no longer a necessarily non-digital experience. Rather,“the modern play and consumption of D\&D [is] more hybrid than initially accounted for”(Sidhu and Carter 2020, 11). Echoing other forms of hybrid tabletop play (Rogerson et al. 2021), D\&D players increasingly use digital tools to deliver in-game effects, character management tools, and communication opportunities. Key to the experience of an RPG is the customized character that each player creates as their interface to the game world. Character creation, however, is a complex process that presents barriers for new players (Rients 2014, 11-13, Gibson 2020, 69). D\&D characters are traditionally generated manually by players, who roll dice to determine values for attributes such as Intelligence, Strength and Wisdom. These attributes influence and constrain the player’s experiences within the game. With multiple steps in the character creation process and dependencies between aspects of the created character, this necessary precursor to play can seem more chore than play.},

Twelve college students participated in six approximately 4-hour gaming sessions using a customized game system based on Dungeons \& Dragons™ (D\&D, 1974, 4th ed.). The games contained embedded social/moral dilemmas (e.g., whether to torture a prisoner for information) that participants encountered and had to work through as a group. Significant growth in moral development, as measured with the Defining Issues Test and the Self-Understanding Interview was demonstrated in the gaming groups, but was not replicated in two control groups, who did not participate in the gaming sessions. This suggests that imaginative role-play gaming structures can function as an engaging, interactive “moral training ground,” a medium that promotes moral development, and highlights the difference between antisocial and prosocial violence.},

The example ofThe Adventure Zonein particular presents a strong argument that the medium possesses its own singular strengths for storytelling.The Adventure Zoneis a fictional, audio-only, serialised podcast in which a narrative of both considerable length and depth is constructed through the playing of tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons \& Dragons. It is hosted by the McElroy brothers, Griffin, Justin, and Travis, along with their father, Clint.The Adventure Zonedemonstrates the unique qualities and noteworthy potential the podcast medium possesses. The McElroy family collaborates utilising comedy improv practices, which are strengthened by the game's mechanics and rules. The line between characters and players - along with the line between textual and metatextual, canonical and non-canonical, diegetic and non-diegetic data - is significantly blurred through instances such as self-reflexivity and popular culture references. The fourth wall is inapplicable toThe Adventure Zone. It is necessary to re-imagine it instead as a permeable curtain separating the players from the characters. The listeners are provided with a clear view of not only the story ofThe Adventure Zone, but the construction of its creation. There are few mediums in which the audience can so effectively and candidly witness the storytelling process. Comparisons drawn from the original text -The Adventure Zonepodcast - to its ongoing adaptations -The Adventure Zonegraphic novels - illustrates this fact further. The collaborative, improvisational, metafictional qualities of the dynamic audio-only medium of podcasts are absent from static visual mediums.},

  abstract = {This thesis develops a new theorisation of subculture in digital gaming culture. I propose that  online streaming services and online interaction about games have created an under-theorized  subculture of those who engage in the gaming subculture without playing games themselves.    Existing theorisations of subculture in relation to online gaming tend to limit their accounts to  those who are actively engaged in online gaming. However, based on a grounded analysis of  ethnographic observation, surveys, and interviews with the fans for web series Critical Role,  where famous voice actors play Dungeons \& Dragons, I found that reasons for and forms of  engagement, include what I have called participatory non-participation. This form of  engagement, while not incorporated into current theorisations of digital subculture, clearly  shares key elements of subculture activity that include a sense of belonging, requirements for  group membership, shared history and symbols. As existing theories are based solely on active  game playing that excludes the crucial element of digital participatory non-participation, it is  appropriate to extend current theorisations to resolve this lacunae and is offered here as a  distinctly new theory of digital subculture: the subculture of the lurker.},

  abstract = {Tabletop Role-Playing Game is a form of an asymmetrical role-playing game, where participants incarnate in the characters and act out their role, describing their actions through speech. While voice can be enough of a tool for the simplest games, additional ones are usually used for visualization of encounters or for dungeon crawling. This thesis demonstrates a Virtual Tabletop program, which is a game helper tool for preparing and playing tabletop role-playing games. It consists of a procedural generator of dungeon levels, a level editor, and a level play-through simulator. The procedural generation is using modified Space Partitioning Algorithm and Cellular Automaton for two types of dungeon levels, mansion-like and cavern-like respectively. This work also includes an analysis of the most common procedural map generation methods and their usage in game development, as procedural content generation is an increasingly popular way of cutting down costs and development time, while keeping the content original and interesting.},

On the one hand, the survey results point to limitations of the current version of the scenario but also implied essential factors for developing and managing CoC TRPG scenarios and sessions for peace educational purposes. First, for effective sessions, the scenario needs to incorporate the main theme intelligibly for players. Second, letting players think about how their characters perceive social issues may help players rethink their views and contribute to raising awareness of an issue. Third, sessions benefit from adapting them to different formats of play: offline and remote play, voice chat, and text chat sessions.},

  abstract = {When designing tabletop digital games, designers often draw inspiration from board games because of their similarities (e.g., spatial structure, social setting, and physical interaction). As part of our tabletop handheld augmented reality (THAR) games research, in which computer graphics content is rendered and registered on top of the players’ view of the physical world, we are motivated to understand how social play unfolds in board games with the purpose of informing design decisions for THAR games. In this paper we report an empirical study of recorded video from a series of board game play sessions. We present five categories of social interactions based on how each interaction is initiated, among which we believe that the category of “chores” (interactions arising from the bookkeeping activities required to maintain and update game state) provides opportunities and support for four other kinds of social interaction, namely, “Reflection on Gameplay” (reacting to and reflecting on gameplay after a move); “Strategies” (deciding how to play before a move); “Out-of-game” (reacting to and talking about out-of-game subjects); and “Game itself” (commenting on and reacting to the game as an artifact of interest). We note that “chores” in board games (e.g. waiting for a turn, rule learning and enforcement, maneuvering physical objects), which at first appear to be merely functional, are critical for supporting players’ engagement with each other. Although most of these chores can be automated using technology, we argue that this is often not the best choice when designing social interactions with digital media. Based on our experience with THAR games, we discuss several design choices related to “chores”. To understand the connection between game design elements and social experience, we apply Interaction Ritual (IR) theory from micro-sociology to interpret our data.},

  abstract = {Fantasy allows for the intermingling of the imagination and the physical. It creates collective spaces that can reify, reiterate, or challenge socio-economic structures and power dynamics that create inequalities in our everyday lives. Fantasy spaces create the possibility of the impossible, the unbelievable, and the extraordinary, while simultaneously being bound to the real world from which these ideas stem. The creators manufacturing characters, stories, and worlds are conditioned by the social and political context in which they exist, with their own positionality drastically changing the way that they create and interact with stories and storytelling structures, as Garcia’s 2017 work “Privilege, power, and Dungeons \& Dragons: How systems shape racial and gender identities in tabletop role-playing games” details. We explore the history of race, gender, and other social forces in the Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) 5e text, a gaming system that creates a framework of races, classes, and backgrounds for character creation in a roleplaying game. We grapple with our own experiences of how the game can (re)create biases that often go overlooked, creating both feelings of (un)safety for players. In this article, by documenting our experiences playing the game, we explore the ways that Dungeons and Dragons both harmfully recreates the dynamics of the White cis heteropatriarchy, as well as offers space to challenge these same forces, bringing the tumultuous clashing of social forces into the semi-private space of gameplay.},

  abstract = {Today, tabletop role-playing games are a multimillion business and more popular than ever. During the past couple of years, they have also taken the digital world by storm.    This thesis explores the early stages of the design process of a tabletop role-playing game. The topic was chosen for two reasons. First, despite the continuously growing popularity of tabletop role-playing games, the design practicalities and methods of tabletop role-playing designers haven't been a subject of many major academic studies. Second, my own interest towards game design and tabletop role-playing games drove me to research the subject.    The thesis starts with a literature review that presents existing literature and definitions around the topic of game design in general and tabletop role-playing game design in particular. LARP (live action role-playing) design theory is also covered briefly. The theoretical framework concentrates on ideas, design goals and prototypes, the three main interest areas of my research. The research topic was then approached by interviewing seven role-playing game designers from Finland, Australia, Sweden and the United States. The data was analyzed in the manner of qualitative content analysis, and transformed into themes and patterns that are presented as findings. In the end, several interesting themes and design practices were recognized. All the research is conducted by following the principles and ideas of explorative research.    According to the research findings, the design process of tabletop role-playing games focuses heavily around writing. Majority of the designers describe their design work to be writing, and it seems that the act of writing and rewriting is the main tool of thinking for the designers. Another major finding was that the ideas and inspirations seem to be growing from a mixture of genre fiction, personal experiences and nostalgia, and that in the very heart of a viable RPG idea is always a certain experience or emotion. Also, the viable ideas, those that actually lead to published games are always described to be solid and “whole” from the beginning of the design process.    The findings offer a good starting point for any further research. Also, any aspiring tabletop role-playing game designer will find the findings valuable and helpful when designing their own tabletop role-playing games.},

Subsequently, we perform pre-game and post-game emotional assessments employing the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire to scrutinize players’ emotional dynamics throughout the gaming experience. Upon analyzing the collected data, we observe that Role 1 and Role 2 affect players’ positive emotions. Notably, Role 2 exhibits the most pronounced influence on players’ positive emotions. Our findings demonstrate that a TTRPG GM powered by ChatGPT can significantly enhance players’ positive emotions. This leads us to recognize that TTRPG GM powered by ChatGPT plays a positive role in enhancing the mental well-being of specific populations.},

We investigated the social and collaborative aspects of tabletop gaming in the unique context of “social distancing” during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to shed light on the experience of remote tabletop gaming. With a multi-method qualitative approach (including digital ethnography and in-depth interviews), we empirically studied how people appropriate existing technologies and adapt their offline practices to play tabletop games remotely. We identify three themes that describe people's game and social experience during remote play: creating a shared tabletop environment (shared space), enabling a collective understanding (shared information and awareness), and facilitating a communal temporal experience (shared time). We reflect on challenges and design opportunities for a better experience in the age of remote collaboration.},

In our content analysis of the game guidebooks, we found that the games guide players through queer play experiences through tenets of queer theory, while using visibility and direct disclosure of the game’s themes to resist the status-quo of erasing queerness in traditional media. We close with reflections on how other game designers can leverage these strategies to support and uplift queer gamers.},

In their foundational game studies text Rules of Play, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman acknowledge that their definition of a game considers RPGs a borderline case. When scholars, designers, and fans use the words "role-playing games", they typically do not speak about all phenomena called "role-playing games" but usually refer to one of several clusters of phenomena, which we call forms. The empirical phenomena referred to as "role-playing games" are very heterogeneous, spanning different socio-material assemblages: joint talk and paper inscriptions, joint embodiment, and single and networked computing devices. Role-playing games is a word used by multiple social groups to refer to multiple forms and styles of play activities and objects revolving around the rule-structured creation and enactment of characters in a fictional world. However, because "role-playing games" is a social category created by humans, it has no unchanging, context-independent essence.},

  abstract = {Much of the literature on role-playing games (RPGs) focuses on their social, performative, experiential, and/or narrative aspects. The emphasis is on the playing of the roles, as it were, and less so on the game mechanics. Curiously, the phrase ‘RPG elements’ tends not to refer to the role-playing aspects of the genre, but to the rules, systems, and mechanisms that have been co-opted by other game genres and ‘gamification’ practitioners. In this article we unpack the term ‘RPG elements’ by examining a single element: mechanisms and systems for character progression in paper and pencil RPGs. In these open ended games, playercontrolled characters’ capabilities change. Characters usually get better; though sometimes they get worse. We describe different ways positive and negative character progression systems are implemented and the role they play. We also discuss some differences we observe between paper and pencil RPGs and those played electronically. We conclude with thoughts on the utility of breaking down ambiguous terms, such as ‘RPG elements’ into smaller, clearer units.},

Collaboratively authored by more than 40 key scholars, it traces the history of RPGs, from wargaming precursors to tabletop RPGs like Dungeons \& Dragons to the rise of live-action role-play and contemporary computer RPG and massively multiplayer online RPG franchises, like Baldur’s Gate, Genshin Impact, and World of Warcraft. Individual chapters survey the perspectives, concepts, and findings on RPGs from key disciplines, like performance studies, sociology, psychology, education, economics, game design, literary studies, and more. Other chapters integrate insights from RPG studies around broadly significant topics, like worldbuilding, immersion, and player-character relations, as well as explore actual play and streaming, diversity, equity, inclusion, jubensha, therapeutic uses of RPGs, and storygames, journaling games, and other forms of text-based RPGs. Each chapter includes definitions of key terms and recommended readings to help students and scholars new to RPG studies find their way into this interdisciplinary field. A comprehensive reference volume ideal for students and scholars of game studies and immersive experiences and those looking to learn more about the ever-growing, interdisciplinary field of RPG studies.},

By developing 3 sample games based on Greek mythology, Arthurian legends, and a widespread folktale type, I explored the process of creating games that fit the limits of secondary classrooms and can be used to address specific educational standards. The sample games were tested with groups of high school and college students, and the results of the testing sessions evaluated in a narrative case study format. Feedback from the testing sessions was incorporated in the template, the final product of the thesis project. By exploring tabletop role-playing as a form of emergent interactive storytelling, a connection has been created between traditional storytelling and popular culture with the hope of reaching out to new audiences and introducing a stronger interactive element into storytelling in secondary education.},

How did the posts of a (supposedly) anonymous government insider named Q on an obscure online imageboard in October 2017 instigate a serious conspiracy movement taking part in the storming of the US Capitol in early 2021? Returning to the origins of QAnon on 4chan?s Politically Incorrect board and its initial reception as a potential LARP, we analyze it as an instance of participatory online play that fosters deep engagement above all. Drawing on concepts from play and performance studies, we theorize the dynamics by which QAnon developed into an influential conspiracy narrative as instances of ?conspiracy fictioning.? In particular, we revive the notion of hyperstition to make sense of how such conspiracy fictionings work to recursively ?bootstrap? their own alternate realities into existence. By thus exploring the participatory and playful engagement mechanisms that drive today?s conspiracy movements, we aim to elucidate the epistemological and socio-political dynamics that mark the growing entanglement of play and politics, fact and fiction in society.},

Based on the data collected from the online survey of 404 LARP players in Taiwan, gaming performance, narrative transportation and TEBOTS predicted enjoyment significantly. Also, partial mediation of TEBOTS between gaming performance, narrative transportation and enjoyment was found. The results of this study are consistent with the previous research that there are correlations among narrative transportation, TEBOTS, and enjoyment in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). In LARP games, the players' gaming performance is a significant contributor of enjoyment. Based on the results of post hoc analysis, young adults are the most frequent players; female players enjoy LARP more than male players. Less frequent (less than five times a year) players had lower scores on enjoyments, game performance, narrative transportation and TEBOTS; player with more than 2 types in comparison with single type revealed a similar result.},

Specifically, we choose Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) -- a role-playing game consisting of multiple player characters and a Dungeon Master (DM) who collaborate to achieve a set of goals that are beneficial to the players -- as a testbed for this task. Here, each of the player characters is a student, with their own personas and abilities, and the DM is the teacher, an arbitrator of the rules of the world and responsible for assisting and guiding the students towards a global goal. We propose a theory-of-mind-inspired methodology for training such a DM with reinforcement learning (RL), where a DM: (1) learns to predict how the players will react to its utterances using a dataset of D\&D dialogue transcripts; and (2) uses this prediction as a reward function providing feedback on how effective these utterances are at guiding the players towards a goal. Human and automated evaluations show that a DM trained with RL to generate guidance by incorporating a theory-of-mind of the players significantly improves the players' ability to achieve goals grounded in their shared world.},

The DM must digest information about the game setting and monsters, synthesize scenes to present to other players, and respond to the players' interactions with the scene. Doing all of these tasks while maintaining consistency within the narrative and story world is no small feat of human cognition, making the task tiring and unapproachable to new players. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities to generate coherent natural language text. In this paper, we conduct a formative evaluation with DMs to establish the use cases of LLMs in D\&D and tabletop gaming generally. We introduce CALYPSO, a system of LLM-powered interfaces that support DMs with information and inspiration specific to their own scenario. CALYPSO distills game context into bite-sized prose and helps brainstorm ideas without distracting the DM from the game. When given access to CALYPSO, DMs reported that it generated high-fidelity text suitable for direct presentation to players, and low-fidelity ideas that the DM could develop further while maintaining their creative agency. We see CALYPSO as exemplifying a paradigm of AI-augmented tools that provide synchronous creative assistance within established game worlds, and tabletop gaming more broadly.},

We present FIREBALL, a large dataset containing nearly 25,000 unique sessions from real D\textbackslash\&D gameplay on Discord with true game state info. We recorded game play sessions of players who used the Avrae bot, which was developed to aid people in playing D\&D online, capturing language, game commands and underlying game state information. We demonstrate that FIREBALL can improve natural language generation (NLG) by using Avrae state information, improving both automated metrics and human judgments of quality. Additionally, we show that LLMs can generate executable Avrae commands, particularly after finetuning.},

  abstract = {"In the introduction to the 5th edition Player's Handbook for Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons and Dragons, the classic tabletop roleplaying game is described as sharing ""elements with childhood games of make-believe."" 1 Building from that place of childlike wonder, the reader is told that ""anything is possible"" in a game of Dungeons and Dragons (DND), assuming the dice roll in your favor.? This invocation of childlike wonder and possibility, however, reveals a limitation not explicitly stated but nonetheless present at the tables of many players: certain realms of ""adult"" material are discouraged if not outright forbidden. Tabletop gaming, in general, tends to reflect the confounding American acceptance of violence, even extreme and gruesome violence, while rejecting sexuality and sex almost completely. In this chapter, we explore one way that players and enthusiasts have attempted to resist this aversion and to fulfill their desire to make visible the unspoken erotic possibilities of tabletop roleplay: through the creation of fan fiction. Framing our analysis through Henry   enkins's foundational work on fandoms, Textual Poahners, we examine the works of fan authors in relationship to the boundaries of play offered by the wildly popular actual-play webshow Critical Role and the actual-play podcast The Adventure Zone. Through this analysis, we argue that fan fiction exploring the romantic and sexual adventures of characters from these series acts as a strategy through which fans can circumvent the widespread spread antipathy toward sex and sexuality at the table. We blend the broader definition of a kink as a curve or twist in something otherwise straight with its often colloquial emphasis on eccentricity and peculiarity, especially in sexual practices. We also draw on the work of feminist writer and activist Tristan Taormino, who describes kink as ""an intimate experience, and exchange of power between people that can be physical, erotic, sexual, psychological, spiritual, or, most often, some combination. People who practice kink explore the territory between pleasure and pain, eroticize the exchange of power, experience intense physical sensations and psychological scenarios, and test and push their limits."" 5 Thus, throughout this chapter these three descriptions of the term ""kink"" converge and function as an umbrella term for unconventional, non-normative practices. Ultimately, then, this chapter highlights the ways these fan-created texts attempt to resolve the contradiction at the intersection of fantasy gaming and sexual fantasy: namely, the exploration, discovery, and play offered by sex and kink are often forbidden at tables where exploration, discovery, and play would seem to be the.whole point. To begin this discussion, we will turn first to the fraught role of sex and sexuality in tabletop games."},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the potential of Dungeons and Dragons (D\&D) as a new peace method. Using an autoethnographic approach informed by Ganz's (2015) 3-level storytelling method and Haven's (2015) core story components, this exploratory research grounds D\&D in PACS literature and theory. While sharing compelling examples of how critical peace skills and critical consciousness development can be facilitated by playing a game of imaginative worldbuilding and creative conflict simulation.  This thesis probes D\&D's PACS relevance through cultural, educational, play, and identity lenses and explores how D\&D can deploy theoretical PACS principles as active, positive peace training. The significance of this study is twofold. First, it lays the groundwork for further research into the positive peace potential of D\&D while simultaneously contributing utopian storytelling experiential knowledge to the growing field of PACS literature. Second, it challenges the traditional hegemony of patient hope-sustaining banking education systems of knowledge replication.},

  abstract = {RP games are increasingly becoming a phenomenon of contemporary education. Although a number of ready-made educational LARP games are offered, in connection with the covid-19 pandemic, the question arose of their transformation into a partially digital form with the preservation of live play at least in the form of partial game activities. The article is devoted to the description of our experience with the creation of a year-round role-playing game and its implementation in a digital environment. The game is focused on science education – chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics and is implemented in the LMS Moodle environment. Partial conclusions and feedback on the chosen computer environment after piloting the first part of the game will also be described.},
